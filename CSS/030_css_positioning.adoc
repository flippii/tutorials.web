== Positioning HTML elements with CSS

CSS allows to setup element with fixed, relate and absolute positions. 
Relative is the standard and will change the distribution of the different text containers based on the available space. 

Frequently you want to make sure that you boxes stay on a specific place. 
You can use postion:absolute for this. 
A block element with this style will be removed from the normal flow of the HTML page and will have a fixed space. 
For example:

----
include::examples/positioning/absolute.html[]
----

If you want to have a element always on a certain position you can use the fixed position and
will not move even if you scroll down the HTML page. 

----
include::examples/positioning/csspositioning.html[]
----
