[[boxmodel_margins]]
=== Margins

A block element can be thought of as a box which contains something.
This box has a border to other elements and you can influence the distance to other elements via the 'margin' and 'padding' settings.

Margin defines the outer distance of other elements. 
You can set values for top, right, bottom and left.

The total size of the HTML box is defined by the initial size of the box, plus the margins and the padding and a border, if defined.
