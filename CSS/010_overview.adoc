=== What is CSS?

'Cascading Style Sheets' (CSS) allow you to define styles, layouts and spacing separate from the content which should be styled.
The CSS information is typically contained in an external file.
Other code, e.g., an HTML page, can reference to the CSS file for its layout information. 
For example you define in an external file the fonts and colors used for certain elements.

CSS is defined as a standard. Currently the versions _CSS 2.1_ and _CSS 3_ are most widely used.

=== CSS selectors and style rules

The CSS standard defines _selectors_ and _style rules_.
The syntax is defined as follows:

----
include::res/first/selector.txt[]
----

A selector can be one of a predefined identifier(, e.g., H1), a class name (e.g. .myclass) or an identifier (e.g. #myuniqueid).

In CSS an identifier is supposed to be unique across all of the elements in a page (or window in our case) while a class can be assigned to several elements.

For example the following CSS file defines the size and color of the 'h1' tag.

=== CSS pseudo classes

_CSS pseudo classes_ are used to qualify attributes of selectors. 
For example you can select an visited link in HTML and style is differently.
