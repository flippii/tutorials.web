== CSS media queries and responsive design

Via CSS you can use media queries to define CSS settings based on certain criteria. 
A common use case is to have different CSS based styling for devices with only limited pixels and other designs for larger screens.

For example the following CSS defines a fixed position for a search box. 
If the screen has a maximum width of 750 or less different styling is used.
