[[css_version]]
== Versioning of CSS 

The versioning of css files is not mandatory, but it could be very useful to force the browser to load a changed css file instead of 
using the CSS caching.

To achieve this just add '?version=1.1' at the end of the css file name when referencing to the file.

So instead of calling a css file like this:
----
https://www.vogella.com/css/companyfooter.css
---- 

you should replace it with

----
https://www.vogella.com/css/companyfooter.css?version=1.1
---- 

The wording after the '?' has no relevance and can be chosen freely. 
With this solution your css changes are immediately visible and you do not need to refresh your browser with CTRL F5 until you see them.
Additionally the name of the css file keeps the same which saves you a global search and replace.
