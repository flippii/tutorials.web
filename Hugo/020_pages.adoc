== Pages

Every content file that gets converted by hugo is called a page.
Each page has a `Kind` attribute that determines which layout file is used for rendering.
Hugo differentiates between single or regular pages and list pages.
On all pages the variables of the current page can be accessed via the `.`.
Eg., `.Title` will print the title of the current page.
