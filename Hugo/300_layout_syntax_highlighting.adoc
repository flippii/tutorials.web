== Go Template syntax highlighting for layout files

While the layout files for hugo have to end with `.html`, they are actually Go templates instead of static html files.
Sadly, many editors will determine which syntax highlighting to use for a file by the file ending.

A workaround for this is to have files ending with the `.gohtml` suffix and reference them from the `.html` files.

├── home.gohtml
└── home.html

[title='home.html']

{{ template "home.gohtml" . }}
