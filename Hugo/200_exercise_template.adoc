== Exercise: Building a hugo blog using a template

First create a new hugo site.

[source, terminal]
----
hugo new site exercise_blog
----

Then download a theme and configure the site to use it.
The default approach is to integrate the theme as a git submodule:

[source, terminal]
----
cd exercise_blog
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/halogenica/beautifulhugo.git themes/beautifulhugo
----

=== Using a theme

Change the config to use the theme.
You can also change the title of the page.

[source, toml, title='config.toml']
----
baseURL = "http://example.org/"
languageCode = "en-us"
title = "A simple blog"
theme = "beautifulhugo"
----

For all the possible configuration options check the https://github.com/halogenica/beautifulhugo/blob/master/README.md[README] of the theme.

When you start the local dev server you should see something like this.

=== Adding content

beautifulhugo defines a https://github.com/halogenica/beautifulhugo/blob/c07daadde82a3b8f2de9c058d7e279aee3d982e6/archetypes/default.md[default archetype] that we can use for our content.
Because the `hugo new site` command also creates a default <<archetypes,archetype>> for our site we first have to remove it.
Then hugo will use the default archetype coming from the theme.

[source, terminal]
----
rm archetypes/default.md
----

==== Adding a blog post

Now add a blog post.
Notice that we put our blog post under the section `post`, because that's where the theme https://github.com/halogenica/beautifulhugo/blob/c07daadde82a3b8f2de9c058d7e279aee3d982e6/layouts/index.html#L12[expects them] to be to show up on the main page.

[source, terminal]
----
hugo new post/introduction-to-the-blog.md
----

Add some text to the file.

[title='/content/post/introduction-to-the-blog.md']
----
---
title: "Introduction to the Blog"
author: ""
type: ""
date: 2019-02-23T10:30:01+01:00
subtitle: ""
image: ""
tags: []
---

Hello from vogella
----

==== Adding an about page

Now create the about page by keying the following into your terminal.

[source, terminal]
----
hugo new page/about.adoc
----

Then edit the file to your preference.

[source, adoc]
----
---
title: "About"
date: 2019-02-22T11:08:21+01:00
subtitle: "Some information about this site"
---

This is an example page.
----

To make it show up in the site navigation you have to add it to the menu in the config file.

[source, toml, title='config.toml']
----
baseURL = "http://example.org/"
languageCode = "en-us"
title = "A simple blog"
theme = "beautifulhugo"

[[menu.main]]
    name = "About"
    url = "page/about/"
----
