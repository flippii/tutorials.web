== Installation

The latest version of hugo can be downloaded from the https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases[GitHub Releases page].
Download the artifact for your operating system and follow the instructions.

NOTE: If you want to have sass/scss support you have to download the "extended" version.

Depending on your operating system you can also install hugo via a package manager, although this might not install the latest version.

[source, terminal]
----
# Debian / Ubuntu, this will install the extended version
sudo apt install hugo

sudo pacman -Syu hugo
# Fedora
sudo dnf install hugo
# Snap (Linux)
snap install hugo --channel=extended
# Homebrew (macOS)
brew install hugo
# chocolatey (Windows)
choco install hugo -confirm

You can verify that the installation was successful by executing the hugo version command.
