== Tooling for Dojo

Any editor can be used for writing TypeScript code. For example:

* https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/eclipse-wild-web-developer-web-development-eclipse-ide[Eclipse Wild Web Developer for the Eclipse IDE]
* https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code]

Once the right editor has been chosen Node JS, NPM and the https://github.com/dojo/cli[Dojo CLI] should be installed.

For Node JS a version manager called nvm can be used:

[source, console]
----
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash
nvm install node
----

Now Node JS and NPM should be installed and the dojo CLI can be installed globally like this:

[source, console]
----
npm install -g @dojo/cli
----
