== Exercise - Using the Dojo Store

In order to avoid that the `App` class is polluted with its child widgets' states and methods Dojo provides a concept of Containers,

NOTE: _State management_ for smaller applications is covered by the official Dojo tutorials. https://dojo.io/tutorials/1010_containers_and_injecting_state/
