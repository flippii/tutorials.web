== First Dojo Project

To be able to generate a single page application _@dojo/cli-create-app_ has to be installed:

[source, console]
----
npm install -g @dojo/cli-create-app
----

To create the actual project run:

[source, console]
----
dojo create app --name user-app
----

NOTE: This is based on Dojo 5 and may look different in future versions.

The app can be built by running:

[source, console]
----
dojo build --mode dev --watch --serve <1>

// or ...

dojo build <2>
----

<1> Starts a local server (http://localhost:9999/), which tracks file changes and rebuilds automatically. 
<2> Builds a distribution of the app in the _user-app/output/dist_ folder, which can be deployed on a real server or be run without server.

In the following chapters the source code of the _user-app_ single page webapplication will be explained.
