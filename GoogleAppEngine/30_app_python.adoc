[[app_python]]
== Developing your first application

In this part of the tutorial we will develop a small Todo list.
This list will allow you to store todos, send out email reminders to
yourself and delete todos. You can also store a URL and a description
to each todo.

I suggest to use Eclipse with Pydevas IDE as Python interprets
intension
as inclination of blocks and therefore you may run into
problems
copying code from this tutorial if you use a standard text
editor.

The source of this example is stored in project
"de.vogella.gae.python.todo" and can be browsed on
http://www.vogella.com/code.html[www.vogella.com source code].

[[app_python_dir]]
=== Directory

Create a new directory "googleappengine01", e.g.
c:\temp\googleappengine01. All the following files must be created
within this directory.

[[app_python_config]]
=== Configuration File

Create the following configuration file for your application.
It define the application name, the runtime and defines the handler
script which should get invoked for a specific URL.

[source,text]
----
include::res/first/app.yaml[]
----

The script defines that all URL request will be handled by the
script "todo.py". It also defines two static directories in which
static content is stored which can also be served. Without this
definition the Google app engine would not deliver this content to
the webbrowser.

[[app_python_application]]
=== Create the application

Python allows to define several classes in one source file. We are
going to create the following classes:

* TodoModel: Defines the data model for your application.
* MainPage: Serves as the main entry point, user validation is checked here
* New: This class will create the new Todo in the database
* Done: Marks the todo as complete and deletes it from the database
* Email: Sends the selected todo to yourself via email as a reminder

TIP: Email notification does not work in the local version. 
This feature is only available after the upload to the Google cloud.

Create the file "todo.py" with the following content. Study the
source code; I tried to document it well in the hope that it is
self-explaining.

[source,text]
----
include::res/first/todo.py[]
----

This class MainPage uses a HTML template "index.html" for the
rendering. Create the following file.

TIP: This uses the Django template language. 
See the appendix for an weblink for the Django template language.

[source,text]
----
include::res/first/index.html[]
----

Also create the directory css and put in this file "main.css".
This is the style sheet used to make index.html "pretty".

[source,text]
----
include::res/first/main.css[]
----

Optional you can put a graphic "todo.png" into the images directory.

[[app_python_run]]
=== Run your application

Switch to a command line. Switch to the directory which
contains your application directory. Start your application locally
with the following command.

[source,text]
----
include::res/first/start.txt[]
----

Switch to a browser and access your local host via: 

....
http://localhost:8080/
....

TIP: You can edit your python source code and just refresh the browser to see the updates.

TIP: To stop the server press kbd:[Ctrl+Break] on Windows, Unix and Linux using the standard kbd:[Ctrl+C].

[[app_python_clean]]
=== Clean your test data

The local installation will store your test data until you tell the engine to delete the test data. 
Use therefore the --clear_datastore option during startup.

[source,text]
----
include::res/first/clear.txt[]
----

[[app_python_upload]]
=== Deploy your application

Now deploy your application to the Google cloud. Open the following
URL
http://appengine.google.com/]] http://appengine.google.com/]
and login with your Google User. Press the button "Create an application".

You need then to verify your account via an SMS.
Create an application name. You have to choose one which is
still available. After you found one you need to change the
application in the app.yaml file to this new name.

Use now the command line to upload your application.

[source,text]
----
include::res/first/deploy.txt[]
----

Thats it. You should now be able to find your application at
http://yourname.appspot.com/. For example this example can be found
at http://myvogella.appspot.com/.
