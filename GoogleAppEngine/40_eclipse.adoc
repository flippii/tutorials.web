[[eclipse]]
== Using Eclipse

You can also use Eclipse for developing GAE applications via the PyDev plugin.

[[eclipse_pydev]]
=== Eclipse and Pydev

Please see
https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Python/article.html[Python Development with Eclipse]
to learn how to install and use Eclipse and Pydev. The remaining
focuses on the additional setup to use the GAE.

[[eclipse_project]]
=== Project

Create a Python project called "de.vogella.gae.python.todo". See
https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Python/article.html[Python Development with Eclipse]
for how to create a new Pydev / Python project in Eclipse.

Use Python version 2.5. Remember that the GAE does currently
only support Python version 2.5
Copy the content of the directory from the previous example
(all your files and directeries): todo.py, app.yam, index.html)into
the source folder.

[[eclipse_gaesdk]]
=== Make GAE SDK available

We need to add the GAE SDK to the pythonpath. Right-click your
project and select properties. Select PYTHONPATH and press "Add
source folder" in the "External Source Folder". Select the
installation directory of the GAE SDK. Also add lib/django,
lib/webob and lib/yaml.

[[eclipse_run]]
=== Run your application

You still can use the command line to run your GAE application.
But we are now going to configure Eclipse to allow you to run your
application directly from Eclipse.
Right-click on "todo.py", select menu:Run As[Run Configuration].
Under Main Module maintain the path to dev_appserver.py.

Switch to the argument tab and maintain the full path name of your project as a parameter. 
Put the parameter in double-quotes.

Click run to start your application. If you have the console
view open menu:Window[Show View > Console] you should see the
familiar output of the GAE and be able to open the application in
your browser as before.
