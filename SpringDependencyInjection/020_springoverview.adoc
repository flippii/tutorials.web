== Spring Overview

The Spring Framework is a very comprehensive framework.
The fundamental functionality provided by the Spring Container is dependency injection. 
Spring provides a light-weight container, e.g. the Spring core container, for dependency injection (DI).
This container lets you inject required objects into other objects. 
This results in a design in which the Java class are not hard-coupled. 
The injection in Spring is either done via setter injection of via construction injection.
These classes which are managed by Spring must conform to the JavaBean standard.
In the context of Spring classes are also referred to as beans or as Spring beans.

The Spring core container:

* handles the configuration, generally based on annotations or on an XML file (XMLBeanFactory)
* manages the selected Java classes via the BeanFactory

The core container uses the so-called bean factory to create new objects. 
New objects are generally created as Singletons if not specified differently.
