[[Installation]]
== Spring Installation

Download Spring from http://www.springframework.org/download.
Select the -with-dependencies.zip to get also all required plugins. 
At the time of writing I downloaded the version Spring Framework 2.5.5.

The folder "dist" contains the Spring container "spring.jar". 
The folder lib contains additional require libraries. 
A minimal Spring application requires the spring.jar, commons-logging.jar (from \lib\jakarta-commons) and log4j*.jar (from \lib\log4j).
