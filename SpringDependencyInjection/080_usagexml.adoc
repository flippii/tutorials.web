== Using dependency injection with XML

The following example will demonstrate the usage of the
		dependency injection via xml. The example will inject a writer into
		another class.

TIP: I think annotations rock in general, therefore I recommend not to use the XML configuration but the annotation one. 
If you have good reason to use the XML configuration please feel free to do so.
	
Create a new Java project "de.vogella.spring.di.xml.first" and include the minimal required spring jars into your classpath.
Copy your model class from the de.vogella.spring.di.model project into this project.
Under the src folder create a folder META-INF and create the following file in this folder. 
This is the Spring configuration file.
	
[source,xml]
----
include::res/xml/beans.xml[]
----
	
Again, you can now wire the application together. 
Create a main class which reads the configuration file and starts the application.
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/xml/Main.java[]
