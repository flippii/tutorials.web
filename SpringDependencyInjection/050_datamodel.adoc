[[datamodel]]
== Datamodel

We will later use the following datamodel for the example.
	
Create a Java project "de.vogella.spring.di.model" and create the following packages and classes.

[source,java]
----
include::res/datamodel/IWriter.java[]
----
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/datamodel/Writer.java[]
----

[source,java]
----
include::res/datamodel/NiceWriter.java[]
----

[source,java]
----
include::res/datamodel/MySpringBeanWithDependency.java[]
----
	
The class "MySpringBeanWithDependency.java" contains a setter for the actual writer. 
We will use the Spring Framework to inject the correct writer into this class.
