== Java XML overview

The Java programming language contains several methods for processing and writing XML.

Older Java versions supported only the DOM API (Document Object Model) and the SAX (Simple API for XML) API.

In DOM you access the XML document over an object tree. 
DOM can be used to read and write XML files.

SAX (Simple API for XML) is a Java API for sequential reading of XML files. 
SAX can only read XML documents.
SAX provides an event driven XML Processing following the Push-Parsing model.
In this model you register listeners in the form of Handlers to the Parser.
These are notified through call-back methods.

Both DOM and Sax are older APIs and I recommend not using them anymore.

Stax (Streaming API for XML) is an API for reading and writing XML Documents. 
It was introduced in Java 6.0 and is considered superior to SAX and DOM.

https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JAXB/article.html[Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB)] is a Java standard that allows to convert Java objects to XML and vice versa.
JAXB defines a programmer API for reading and writing Java objects to from XML documents.
It also defines a service provider which allows the selection of the JAXB implementation. 
JAXB applies a lot of defaults thus making reading and writing of XML via Java very easy.

The following explains the Stax interface; for an introduction to JAXB, please see https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JAXB/article.html[JAXB tutorial].
