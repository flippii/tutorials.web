== Streaming API for XML (StaX)

[[javastax_overview]]
=== Overview

Streaming API for XML, called StaX, is an API for reading and writing XML Documents.

StaX is a Pull-Parsing model. Application can take the
control
over parsing the XML documents by pulling (taking)
the events from the
parser.

The core StaX API falls into two categories and they are
listed below.
They are

* Cursor API
* Event Iterator API

Applications can use any of these two API for parsing XML
documents.
The following will focus on the event iterator
API as I consider it
more convenient to use.

[[javastax_api]]
=== Event Iterator API

The event iterator API has two main interfaces:
XMLEventReader
for parsing XML and XMLEventWriter for
generating XML.

[[javastax_read]]
=== XMLEventReader - Read XML Example

This example is stored in project "de.vogella.xml.stax.reader".

Applications loop over the entire document requesting for
the
Next Event. The Event Iterator API is implemented on top
of the Cursor
API.

In this example we will read the following XML document and
create objects from it.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/staxread/config.xml[]
----

Define therefore the following class to store the individual
entries of the XML file.

[source,java]
----
include::res/staxread/Item.java[]
----

The following reads the XML file and creates a List of object
Items from the entries in the XML file.

[source,java]
----
include::res/staxread/StaXParser.java[]
----

You can test the parser via the following test program. 
Please note that the file `config.xml` must exist in the Java project folder.

[source,java]
----
include::res/staxread/TestRead.java[]
----

[[javastax_write]]
=== Write XML File Example

This example is stored in project "de.vogella.xml.stax.writer".

Let's assume you would like to write the following simple XML file.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/staxwrite/config.xml[]
----

StaX does not provide functionality to automatically format the XML file so you have to add end-of-lines and tab
information to your XML file.

[source,java]
----
include::res/staxwrite/StaxWriter.java[]
----

And a little test.

[source,java]
----
include::res/staxwrite/TestWrite.java[]
----
