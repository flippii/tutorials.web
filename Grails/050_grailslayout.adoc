=== Changing the generated views

If you are not satisfied with the order of the fields, you can
change the views directly. For example in the following view

=== Using CSS

Grails created the default CSS style sheets under the
directory `web-app/css/main.css`


You can directly change the main.css to make your
application look different. For example if the feedback
field should be larger then the name field add then
following to main.css.
