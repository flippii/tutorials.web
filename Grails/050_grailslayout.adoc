=== Using CSS

Grails created the default CSS style sheets under the
directory `web-app/css/main.css`


You can directly change the main.css to make your application look different. 
For example if the feedback field should be larger than the name field add the following to main.css.

[source,css]
----
include::res/css/main.css[]
