== Using Eclipse for Grails development
	
		The following requires that Eclipse is
		installed with the Groovy plug-in. Please see
		http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Groovy/article.html[
			Groovy Eclipse Plugin]
		for more information.
	
	
		After running `grails create-app`
		you may notice the `.project`
		and `.classpath` file.
		These Eclipse related files are
		created
		automatically
		and allow you to import the project into Eclipse.
		Import
		your project via
menu:File[Import > General > Existing Project into Workspace]

		The environment variable 
		`GRAILS_HOME` may not be
		set in Eclipse.
		Select your project, right-click on
		it and select _properties_.
		Select the Java Build Path and here the tab
		btn:[Libraries]. Press btn:[Add
		Variable] and then btn:[Configure Variables]. Press
		btn:[New] and add
		`GRAILS_HOME`.
	
	
		<tip>
			At least for me the configuration dialog showed an error. I did
			ignore this error and the re-compiled project did not show errors.
		
	
	
		A tighter integration of Grails is achieved by the
		http://www.grails.org/STS+Integration">
			SpringSource Tool Suite (STS)].
