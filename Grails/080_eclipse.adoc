== Using Eclipse for Grails development

The following requires that Eclipse is installed with the Groovy plug-in. 
Please see https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Groovy/article.html[Groovy Eclipse Plugin] for more information.

After running `grails create-app`
you may notice the `.project`
and `.classpath` file.
These Eclipse related files are
created
automatically
and allow you to import the project into Eclipse.
Import
your project via
menu:File[Import > General > Existing Project into Workspace]

The environment variable 
`GRAILS_HOME` may not be
set in Eclipse.
Select your project, right-click on
it and select _properties_.
Select the Java Build Path and here the tab
btn:[Libraries]. Press btn:[Add
Variable] and then btn:[Configure Variables]. Press
btn:[New] and add
`GRAILS_HOME`.

TIP: At least for me the configuration dialog showed an error. 
I did ignore this error and the re-compiled project did not show errors.

A tighter integration of Grails is achieved by the http://www.grails.org/STS+Integration[SpringSource Tool Suite (STS)].
