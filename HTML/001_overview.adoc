[[overview_what]]
=== What is HTML?

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a standard to describe the
content of webpages. HTML pages are
text files which typically end
with the ".html" extension. 
HTML is a _markup language_.

The
current version of HTML is HTML5. HTML5
supports XML syntax.
This tutorial uses the HTML5 XML syntax.

In HTML you describe the
content in pure text, by
defining
text
as
headings,
paragraphs, lists, etc. A tag is a text
surrounded by
angle
brackets. Tags usually have a
beginning and end
and
contain
other text
between the start and end
tag. The normal content
of
the webpage is
placed between the <body> </body> tags, the <head> </head> tag contains general information about the webpage.

HTML by ifself does not define a lot of display options. You use

to define how HTML element should be displayed.

[[overview_structure]]
=== A structured example

HTML5 introduced several new ways of classifying content of the
webpage, e.g., <nav> </nav>
for the navigation part of the page, <article>
to represent an independent article,<aside> </aside>
to represent a sidebar with related information.<footer> </footer>
for a footer in the HTML page and <address> </address>
for the contact information of the author.

The following displays an example which uses these new
elements. Most
browser will not change the display based on them but
you can use
https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/CSS/article.html[CSS]
to select these elements and style them accordingly.
