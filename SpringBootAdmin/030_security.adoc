== Security

To show meaningful data SpringBootAdmin needs access to sensitive metric endpoints.
Currently, these are not secured and _could_ be accessed by anyone.

To prevent this we can use SpringSecurity.
This is a project developed by the Spring developers that provides the ability to fine tune any web related security setting.

=== Setup

To truly secure your monitoring setup it is advisable to add the SpringSecurity dependency to both the server and the clients.

==== Server

First we will focus on securing the server application.
Add the following dependency to your `build.gradle`.

.build.gradle
[source, groovy]
----
implementation group: 'org.springframework.boot', name: 'spring-boot-starter-security', version: '2.1.2.RELEASE'
----

NOTE: Make sure that your SpringBoot version matches the version of the `spring-boot-starter-security`

Refresh your Gradle project to fetch the new dependencies.

Create a new class `WebSecurityConfig` in the same package your `SpringBootAdminApplication` is in.
Use the following configuration:

.WebSecurityConfig.java
[source, java]
----
@Configuration
public class WebSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

	@Override
	protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {

		http
			.formLogin()
			.loginPage("/login")
			.permitAll();
		http
			.logout().logoutUrl("/logout").permitAll();
		http.csrf()
			.ignoringAntMatchers("/actuator/**", "/instances/**", "/logout");
		http
			.authorizeRequests()
			.antMatchers("/**/*.css", "/assets/**", "/third-party/**", "/logout", "/login")
			.permitAll();
		http
			.authorizeRequests()
			.anyRequest()
			.authenticated();
		http.httpBasic(); // Activate Http basic Auth for the server
	}
}
----

This will configure your application to have a login page.
It will also prevent unauthenticated users from accessing any sensitive data.

You will also need to add an initial user to access the pages.

Add the following to `application.properties`:

.application.properties
[source, properties]
----
spring.security.user.name=admin
spring.security.user.password=test
----

TIP: For projects that use version control (like git) it is advisable to set passwords with environment variables.

==== Clients

If you start your client application now it will fail to register.
This is because the clients need to provide authentication to the server as well.

We can provide these credentials in the `application.properties` file:

.application.properties
[source, properties]
----
spring.boot.admin.client.username=admin
spring.boot.admin.client.password=test
----
These credentials are the same you configured during the server setup.

Your application should now register itself successfully.

=== Other configuration

==== Management Server Port

It can be useful to run the management endpoints on a different port than the client application.
This can be done via the `management.server.port` property:

.application.properties
[source, properties]
----
management.server.port=8081
----

Now you could manually deny access to the management port if the server and the client run on the same server.

==== Path of Actuator

If you want to hide the actuator from discovery you can change the default management path.
Use the property `management.endpoints.web.base-path` for this.
