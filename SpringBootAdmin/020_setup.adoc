== Setup

The core functionality of SpringBootAdmin consists of a client and a server library.
Both have to be imported into separate applications.

It's advisable to use a standalone application as the server only serves the purpose of SpringBootAdmin and nothing else.

This tutorial will use the https://spring.io/tools[Spring Tools].

=== Server

Start by creating a new spring boot project.
You can use https://start.spring.io/ as a quick start.

This example project uses Gradle, Java 8+ and SpringBoot 2.1.2.

Chose `com.vogella` as the *group* name.
The *artifact* should be called `spring-boot-admin`.

SpringBootAdmin is capable of using both _servlets_ and the _reactor_ library. 
Chose one and add it to the dependencies.

Your selection should now look similar to this:

Download the generated project via btn:[Generate Project] and import it into Spring Tools as a Gradle project.

Add the SpringBootAdmin dependency to `build.gradle`.

.build.gradle
[source, groovy]
----
implementation group: 'de.codecentric', name: 'spring-boot-admin-starter-server', version: '2.1.2'
----

Refresh the project with a right click on the project: menu:Gradle[Refresh Gradle Project].

Configure the application to start as a SpringBootAdmin server.
This is as simple as adding the annotation `@EnableAdminServer` to `SpringBootAdminApplication.java`.

.SpringBootAdminApplication.java
[source, java]
----
package com.vogella.springbootadmin;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import de.codecentric.boot.admin.server.config.EnableAdminServer;

@EnableAdminServer
@SpringBootApplication
public class SpringBootAdminApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(SpringBootAdminApplication.class, args);
	}
}

----

TIP: If you get any compilation errors double check if Gradle actually refreshed the project by checking the Gradle console output.

Lastly is it advisable to change the port of the server.
The standard port for spring boot servers is 8080.
To avoid collision with any other SpringBoot application change the port in `application.properties` in `src/main/resources`:

.application.properties
[source, properties]
----
server.port=9999
----

To validate if your setup works right click on the project and select menu:Run As[Spring Boot App].
This should start the application at http://localhost:9999/.
You can leave this running as you will register the client application in the next part.

=== Clients

Any SpringBoot application can be a SpringBootAdmin client.

Add the following dependency to the `build.gradle` file of the project you want to monitor:

.build.gradle
[source, groovy]
----
implementation group: 'de.codecentric', name: 'spring-boot-admin-starter-client', version: '2.1.2'
----

NOTE: Keep in mind that there are version constraints by SpringBootAdmin.
The version of the client dependency should match the version of the server.

Again, refresh the project by clicking menu:Gradle[Refresh Gradle Project].

To configure where the client can reach the monitoring server add the following to your `application.properties`:

.application.properties
[source, properties]
----
spring.boot.admin.client.url=http://localhost:9999
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
----

This tells the client where to register and that every management endpoint should be open for monitoring.

TIP: You should carefully consider which monitoring endpoints you want to expose as they can expose sensitive data.

Now start the client (and the server if it's not already running).

Navigate to http://localhost:9999/.
You should see something like this:

All registered applications should show up here.

TIP: If you don't see the application, check for errors in the clients console output.
