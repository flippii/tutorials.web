== Setup

The core functionality of SpringBootAdmin consists of a client and a server library.
Both have to be imported into separate applications.

It's advisable to use a standalone application as the server that only serves the purpose of SpringBootAdmin and nothing else.

For this tutorial we will use the https://spring.io/tools[Spring Tools].

=== Server

Start by creating a new spring boot project.
You can use https://start.spring.io/ as a quick start.

For this project we will use Gradle, java and spring boot 2.1.2.

Choose `com.vogella` as the *group* name.
The *artifact* should be called `spring-boot-admin`.

SpringBootAdmin is capable of using both servlets and the reactor library. 
Choose one and add it to the dependencies.

Your selection should now look similar to this:

Download the generated project via btn:[Generate Project].
Import the project into Spring Tools as a Gradle project.

Add the SpringBootAdmin dependency to `build.gradle`.

[source, groovy]
----
implementation group: 'de.codecentric', name: 'spring-boot-admin-starter-server', version: '2.1.2'
----

Refresh the project via right click on the project: menu:Gradle[Refresh Gradle Project].

Now we need to configure the application to start as a SpringBootAdmin server.
To do this open `SpringBootAdminApplication.java` and add the following annotations to the class:

[source, java]
----
@EnableAdminServer
@EnableAutoConfiguration
@Configuration
public class SpringBootAdminApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(SpringBootAdminApplication.class, args);
	}

}
----

TIP: If you get any compilation errors double check if Gradle actually refreshed the project by checking the Gradle console output.

Lastly is it advisable to change the port of the server.
The standard port for spring boot servers is 8080. 
Change the port in the `application.properties` in `src/main/resources`:

[source, properties]
----
server.port=9999
----

To validate if your setup works right click on the project and select menu:Run As[Spring Boot App].
This should start the application at http://localhost:9999/.
You can leave this running as you will register the client application in the next part.

=== Clients

Any spring boot application can be a SpringBootAdmin client.

Add the following dependency to the `build.gradle` file of the project you want to monitor:

[source, groovy]
----
implementation group: 'de.codecentric', name: 'spring-boot-admin-starter-client', version: '2.1.2'
----

Again, refresh the project by clicking menu:Gradle[Refresh Gradle Project].

To configure where the monitoring server lives add the following to your `application.properties`:

[source, properties]
----
spring.boot.admin.client.url=http://localhost:9999
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
----

This tells the client where to register and that every management endpoint should be open for monitoring.
We change the last part later as this is not very secure and should not be in any production system.

Now start the client (and the server if it's not already running).

Navigate to http://localhost:9999/.
You should see something like this:

You will see all your registered applications here.
