== Debugging GWT applications

Debugging a GWT application in development mode is easy. In this case
you can just debug the Java code. Put a breakpoint into your code
and start the debugger via selecting your project, right-click
-> debug as -> Web Application.

You can then use standard Eclipse debugging capabilities.
