== Create your first GWT application

The following is a description of the usage of the Google
plug-in to create a new GWT application. plugin.

[[firstgwt_project]]
=== Project

Select menu:File[New > Web Application Project]. 
Enter the name "de.vogella.gwt.helloworld" for your project and the java package.
Only select "Use Google Web
Toolkit", as we will not use the
https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/GoogleAppEngineJava/article.html[Google App Engine] in this tutorial.

TIP: Unfortunately the Google Plugin does not allow to create a new Web Application Project without creating template files. 
The template files are nice for the first try but annoying if you want to start from scratch with a new GWT application. 
Please stare / vote for bug http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=1547[Issue 1547] to get this solved.

Delete all java files under the package "client" and "server".

[[firstgwt_entrypoint]]
=== GWT entry point

Create the following Java class "HelloGwt" in the "de.vogella.gwt.helloworld.client" package.

[source,java]
----
include::res/firstgwt/HelloGwt.java[]
----

Create the file
"De_vogella_gwt_helloworld.gwt.xml" in package
"de.vogella.gwt.helloworld" to the following.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/firstgwt/De_vogella_gwt_helloworld.gwt.xml[]
----

This file defines your entry point to your application. In GWT
the entry point is similar to the main method in Java.

[[firstgwt_html]]
=== HTML page

In the folder "war" you should find a folder with the
file "De_vogella_gwt_helloworld.html". Change this file to the
following.

[source,html]
----
include::res/firstgwt/De_vogella_gwt_helloworld.html[]
----

TIP:  Please note that the HTML files point to the generated
JavaScript file in the script tag. If you are using a different project
name, you need to adjust the path. 

[[firstgwt_webxml]]
=== web.xml

The Google Plugin created also a web.xml and placed a
reference
to a servlet (which we deleted). Change the web.xml to the
following.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/firstgwt/web.xml[]
----

[[firstgwt_css]]
=== Modify CSS

Change the CSS of our application. In
folder war you find a file
"De_vogella_gwt_helloworld.css". Change it
to the following.

[source,css]
----
include::res/firstgwt/De_vogella_gwt_helloworld.css[]
----

TIP: The css file is referred to by the HTML page.

[TIP]
====
You can assign a certain style to your GWT UI elements by using the
"setStyleName"-Method as shown below.

[source,java]
----
include::res/firstgwt/HelloGwtStyles.java[]
----
====

[[firstgwt_run]]
=== Run

To run your application right-click the project and select menu:Run As[Web application].
This opens a new view "Development Mode. 
Copy the url from this view.

Paste this url in your browser and install the required plug-in (is necessary).
