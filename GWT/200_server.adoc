[[server]]
== Client and Server Communication (RPC)

[[server_overview]]
=== Overview

GWT provides its own remote procedure calls (RPC's) which allow
the GWT client to call server-side methods. The implementation of GWT
RPC is based on the servlet technology. GWT allows Java objects to be
sent directly between the client and
the server; which are
automatically serialized by the framework. With
GWT RPC the
communication is
almost
transparent for
the
GWT client and
always
asynchronous so that the client does not block during the
communication.  
The server-side servlet is
usually
referred
to as a "service" and
the remote procedure
call is
referred to
as "invoking a
service." These
object can then be
used on
the
client
(UI)
side. 

To create a GWT service you need to define the following:

* An interface which extends RemoteService that lists the service methods.     
* An implementation - implements the interface and extends the RemoteServiceServlet. 
* Define an asynchronous interface to your service which will be used in the client code     

[[server_project]]
=== Create project and domain model

Create a GWT project
"de.vogella.gwt.helloserver" with the
package
"de.vogella.gwt.helloserver".
Create
the following class which represents the data model . This class
implements
"Serializable"
because GWT requires that all classes that
are involved
in a server
and client communication have to
implement the
interface
"Serializable".

[source,java]
----
include::res/server/MyUser.java[]
----

[[server_interfaces]]
=== Interface

The client server communication is based on an interface which
defines the possible communication methods.
Create the following interface. By extending the RemoteService
interface the GWT compiler will understand that this interface
defines an RPC interface. The annotation defines the URL for the
service. This must match the entry we will later do in `web.xml`.

[source,java]
----
include::res/server/MyUserService.java[]
----

TIP: This interface needs to be available on the client side,
therefore it must be placed in the client package.

GWT uses asynchronous communication therefore you also need to
create the asynchronous version of this interface. The name of this
interface must be the interface name concatenated with "Async".

[source,java]
----
include::res/server/MyUserServiceAsync.java[]
----

TIP: The implementation of this asynchronous interface will be
automatically
created by the GWT compiler.

[[server_service]]
=== Create the server

For the server implementation create a package "de.vogella.gwt.helloserver.server". 
Create the following class which extends RemoteServiceServlet.

[source,java]
----
include::res/server/MyUserServiceImpl.java[]
----

[[server_servlet]]
=== Define servlet in web.xml

To make GWT aware of this service change the web.xml file in
war/WEB-INF to the following.:

[source,xml]
----
include::res/server/web.xml[]
----

[[server_table]]
=== UI component - Table

Create the following two classes which will be used to display
the data in a table. The implementation of "MyTable" is based on
FlexTable. FlexTable allows the building of tables in GWT.

[source,java]
----
include::res/server/table/DataSource.java[]
----

[source,java]
----
include::res/server/table/MyTable.java[]
----

[[server_callback]]
=== Callback

To receive a callback a class needs to be implemented which can then react on a failure or success in the communication. 
The interface AsyncCallback defines these two methods: "OnSuccess" and "OnFailure".

TIP:  Keep in mind that the server communication is asynchronous. If
you call your server your GWT application will continue and at some
undefined point in time it will receive the data from the server.
Make sure that you do not assume in your code that the call to the
server is finished.

Create the following class.

[source,java]
----
include::res/server/MyUserCallback.java[]
----

This will simple print the received results to the command line.

[[server_entrypoint]]
=== Create your entry point

Create the following class.

[source,java]
----
include::res/server/HelloServer.java[]
----

Define your entry point in "De_vogella_gwt_helloserver.gwt.xml".

[source,xml]
----
include::res/server/De_vogella_gwt_helloserver.gwt.xml[]
----

Change your "De_vogella_gwt_helloserver.html" page to the following.

[source,html]
----
include::res/server/De_vogella_gwt_helloserver.html[]
----

Also change the "De_vogella_gwt_helloserver.css" to the following to make the table header look nicer. 

[source,css]
----
include::res/server/De_vogella_gwt_helloserver.css[]
----

[[server_run]]
=== Run

Run your application. 
If you click the button then a list of users on click should get loaded.

The eclipse console shows the values of the users send to your Google Web application via the service.
