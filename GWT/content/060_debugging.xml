== Debugging GWT applications
	 Debugging a GWT application in development mode is easy. In this case
		you can just debug the Java code. Put a breakpoint into your code
		and start the debugger via selecting your project, right-click
		-> debug as -> Web Application.
	
		You can then use standard Eclipse debugging capabilities. Please see
		http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseDebugging/article.html">
			Eclipse Debugging</ulink>
		for details.
