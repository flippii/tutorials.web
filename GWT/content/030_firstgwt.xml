== Create your first GWT application
	 The following is a description of the usage of the Google
	 plug-in to create a new GWT application. plugin.
[[firstgwt_project">
=== Project
		
			Select File > New > Web Application Project. Enter the name
			"de.vogella.gwt.helloworld" for your project and the java package.
			Only select "Use Google Web
			Toolkit", as we will not use the
http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/GoogleAppEngineJava/article.html[
				Google App Engine]
			in this tutorial.

			TIP: 
				Unfortunately the Google Plugin does not allow to create a new Web
				Application Project without creating template files. The template
				files are nice for the first try but annoying if you want to start
				from scratch with a new GWT application. Please stare / vote for bug
				<ulink
					url="http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=1547">
					Issue 1547]
				to get this solved.
			
		
		 Delete all java files under the package "client" and "server".
		

[[firstgwt_entrypoint">
=== GWT entry point
		Create the following
			Java class "HelloGwt" in the
			"de.vogella.gwt.helloworld.client" package.
		
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/firstgwt/HelloGwt.java[]
----
		
		 Create the file
			"De_vogella_gwt_helloworld.gwt.xml" in package
			"de.vogella.gwt.helloworld" to the following.
		
			<programlisting language="xml">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="../examples/firstgwt/De_vogella_gwt_helloworld.gwt.xml[]
----
		
		 This file defines your entry point to your application. In GWT
			the entry point is similar to the main method in Java.

[[firstgwt_html">
=== HTML page
		 In the folder "war" you should find a folder with the
			file "De_vogella_gwt_helloworld.html". Change this file to the
			following.
		
			<programlisting language="html">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="../examples/firstgwt/De_vogella_gwt_helloworld.html[]
----
		
		
			TIP:  Please note that the HTML files point to the generated
				JavaScript file in the script tag. If you are using a different project
				name, you need to adjust the path. 
		

[[firstgwt_webxml">
=== web.xml
		 The Google Plugin created also a web.xml and placed a
			reference
			to a servlet (which we deleted). Change the web.xml to the
			following.
		
		
			<programlisting language="xml">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="../examples/firstgwt/web.xml[]
----
		


[[firstgwt_css">
=== Modify CSS
		 Change the CSS of our application. In
			folder war you find a file
			"De_vogella_gwt_helloworld.css". Change it
			to the following.
		
			<programlisting language="css">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
					parse="text" href="../examples/firstgwt/De_vogella_gwt_helloworld.css[]
----
		

		
			TIP:  The css file is referred to by the HTML page.
		
		
			TIP: 
				You can assign a certain style to your GWT UI elements by using the
				"setStyleName"-Method as shown below.
				<programlisting language="xml">
					<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
						parse="text" href="../examples/firstgwt/HelloGwtStyles.java[]
----
			
		


[[firstgwt_run">
=== Run
		 To run your application right-click the project and select Run
			As -> "Web application".
		 This opens a new view "Development Mode. Copy the url from this
			view.
