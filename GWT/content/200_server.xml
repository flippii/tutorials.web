[[server">
== Client and Server Communication (RPC)
[[server_overview">
=== Overview
		 GWT provides its own remote procedure calls (RPC's) which allow
			the GWT client to call server-side methods. The implementation of GWT
			RPC is based on the servlet technology. GWT allows Java objects to be
			sent directly between the client and
			the server; which are
			automatically serialized by the framework. With
			GWT RPC the
			communication is
			almost
			transparent for
			the
			GWT client and
			always
			asynchronous so that the client does not block during the
			communication.  
		The server-side servlet is
			usually
			referred
			to as a "service" and
			the remote procedure
			call is
			referred to
			as "invoking a
			service." These
			object can then be
			used on
			the
			client
			(UI)
			side. 

		
			To create a GWT service you need to define the following:
			
				* An interface which extends RemoteService that lists the
						service
						methods.     
				
				* 
					An implementation - implements the interface and extends the
						RemoteServiceServlet. 
				
				* Define an asynchronous interface to your service which will
						be used in the client code     
				
			
		

[[server_project">
=== Create project and domain model
		 Create a GWT project
			"de.vogella.gwt.helloserver" with the
			package
			"de.vogella.gwt.helloserver".
			Create
			the following class which represents the data model . This class
			implements
			"Serializable"
			because GWT requires that all classes that
			are involved
			in a server
			and client communication have to
			implement the
			interface
			"Serializable".

[[server_interfaces">
=== Interface
		 The client server communication is based on an interface which
			defines the possible communication methods.
		 Create the following interface. By extending the RemoteService
			interface the GWT compiler will understand that this interface
			defines an RPC interface. The annotation defines the URL for the
			service. This must match the entry we will later do in `web.xml`.
		
		
[source,text]
----
include::res/server/MyUserService.java[]
----
		
		
			<tip>This interface needs to be available on the client side,
				therefore it must be placed in the client package.
		
		 GWT uses asynchronous communication therefore you also need to
			create the asynchronous version of this interface. The name of this
			interface must be the interface name concatenated with "Async".
		
		
[source,text]
----
include::res/server/MyUserServiceAsync.java[]
----
		
		
			<tip>The implementation of this asynchronous interface will be
				automatically
				created by the GWT compiler.
		

[[server_service">
=== Create the server
		 For the server implementation create a package
			"de.vogella.gwt.helloserver.server". Create the following class which
			extends RemoteServiceServlet.
		
[source,text]
----
include::res/server/MyUserServiceImpl.java[]
----
		

[[server_servlet">
=== Define servlet in web.xml
		
			To make GWT aware of this service change the web.xml file in
			war/WEB-INF to the following.:
[source,text]
----
include::res/server/web.xml[]
----
		

[[server_table">
=== UI component - Table
		 Create the following two classes which will be used to display
			the data in a table. The implementation of "MyTable" is based on
			FlexTable. FlexTable allows the building of tables in GWT.
		
[source,text]
----
include::res/server/table/DataSource.java[]
----
		
		
[source,text]
----
include::res/server/table/MyTable.java[]
----
		

[[server_callback">
=== Callback
		 To receive a callback a class needs to be implemented which can
			then react on a failure or success in the communication. The
			interface AsyncCallback defines these two methods: "OnSuccess" and
			"OnFailure".
		
			<tip> Keep in mind that the server communication is asynchronous. If
				you call your server your GWT application will continue and at some
				undefined point in time it will receive the data from the server.
				Make sure that you do not assume in your code that the call to the
				server is finished.
		
		 Create the following class.
		
[source,text]
----
include::res/server/MyUserCallback.java[]
----
		
		 This will simple print the received results to the command
			line.


[[server_entrypoint">
=== Create your entry point
		Create the following class.
		
[source,text]
----
include::res/server/HelloServer.java[]
----
		
		 Define your entry point in
			"De_vogella_gwt_helloserver.gwt.xml".
		
[source,text]
----
include::res/server/De_vogella_gwt_helloserver.gwt.xml[]
----
		
		 Change your "De_vogella_gwt_helloserver.html" page to the
			following.
		
[source,text]
----
include::res/server/De_vogella_gwt_helloserver.html[]
----
		
		 Also change the "De_vogella_gwt_helloserver.css" to the
			following to make the table header look nicer. 

		
[source,text]
----
include::res/server/De_vogella_gwt_helloserver.css[]
----
		

[[server_run">
=== Run
		 Run your application. If you click the button then a list
			of
			users on click should get loaded.

		
image::server_result.gif[]
					
				</imageobject>
			</mediaobject>
		
		 The eclipse console shows the values of the users send to
			your
			Google Web application via the service.
