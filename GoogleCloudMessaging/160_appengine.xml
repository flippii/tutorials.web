== Tutorial: Create your server ;-) application

		authentication key via HTTPS. Afterwards it can send messages to
		the device via HTTP by supplying the authentication key and the
		registration ID.
	
	
		To avoid that you have to learn about
		http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseWTP/article.html[server side Java programming]
		we will "simulate" the server by another Android application. In
		general you could create a server side application for example with
		the
http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/GoogleAppEngineJava/article.html[Google App Engine]
		.
	
	 Create a new Android application
		"de.vogella.android.c2dm.server" with the Activity "ServerSimulator".
		Assign the permission "android.permission.INTERNET" to this activity.
	
	Change `main.xml` to the following. 
	
[source,xml]
----
include::res/server/main.xml[]
----
	
	 Change "ServerSimulator" to the following. Make your to use
		your registration key, your user and your password.
	
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/server/ServerSimulator.java[]
