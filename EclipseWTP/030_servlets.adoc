== Exercise: Create and run a servlet

In this exercise you create a servlet which works as a webpage counter. 
It tracks the number of visitors of the webpage and persists the number in a text file.

=== Create web project

Create a new _Dynamic Web Project_ called _com.vogella.web.filecounter_ by selecting menu:File[New > Other... > Web > Dynamic Web Project].

Press twice the btn:[Next] button and select the _Generate web.xml deployment descriptor_ on the last page.

Afterwards press the btn:[Finish] button.

If Eclipse asks you, to switch to the _Java EE Perspective_ answer yes.

A new project has been created with the standard structure of a Java web application. 
The _WEB-INF/lib_ directory holds all the JAR files that the Java web application requires.

=== Creating Data Access Object

Create a new package called
_com.vogella.web.filecounter.dao_.

Create the following new Java class to read and write the
counter value to and from the file.

[source,java]
----
include::res/counter/FileDao.java[]
----

=== Creating the Servlet

Create a servlet. Right-click on your project and select
menu:New[Servlet].

Enter the following data.

Press btn:[finish].

You could also create a servlet without the wizard. The wizard
creates a Java class
which extends the
`javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet`
and
adds the servlet
settings to the
_web.xml_
file.

Enter the following code.

[source,java]
----
include::res/counter/FileCounter.java[]
----

This code will read the counter from a file on the server and
return plain text to the browser. The servlet will increase the
counter if the user was inactive for 5 seconds.

=== Deployment of the servlet

You application must be deployed to the server and started there.
Select your servlet or your project, right-click on it and select
menu:Run As[Run on Server]
from the context menu and select your existing server.

Ensure your servlet is selected to run on the server.

NOTE: In case you get the error "The Tomcat server configuration at
\Servers\Tomcat v7.0 Server at localhost-config is missing. Check
the server for errors.", simply delete the existing server
configuration and create a new one.

Press the btn:[Finish] button.

=== Validate the deployment

If the deployment was successfully you should be able to access your servlet via the following URL:

....
http://localhost:8080/com.vogella.web.filecounter/FileCounter
....

The servlet will return the number of times it was accessed. 
If you wait 5 seconds and refresh the browser, the number should increase.

Congratulations. 
You created your first working servlet with Eclipse WTP!
