== Apache Tomcat

Apache Tomcat is a webcontainer which allows to run Java web applications.
Most of the modern Java web frameworks are based on servlets, e.g. JavaServer Faces, Struts, Spring.
	
Apache Tomcat also provides by default a HTTP connector on port 8080, i.e., Tomcat can also be used as HTTP server.
But the performance of Tomcat is not as good as the performance of a designated web server, like the Apache HTTP server.
