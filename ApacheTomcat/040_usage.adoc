== Managing Apache Tomcat

[[tomcat_startubuntu]]
=== Start Tomcat on Ubuntu (Linux)

In Ubuntu the
_Tomcat_
server
is started automatically. To restart
_Tomcat_
use the following
command.

[source,java]
----
include::res/start/start.txt[]
----

[[tomcat_start]]
=== Start Tomcat on Windows

To start Tomcat use
`tomcat7.exe`
in the bin directory.

[[tomcat_test]]
=== Test Tomcat

The default port for Tomcat is 8080. After starting Tomcat
on
your local machine, you can validate if Tomcat is running the URL:

....
http://localhost:8080
....

This should show a web page similar to the following.

[[tomcat_admin]]
=== Admin console

Tomcat provides a webbased adminstration console which can be
started via the following link: 

....
http://localhost:8080/manager/html
....

The available users can be found in the
`tomcat-users.xml`
file of the Tomcat configuration directory, i.e., the
`/etc/tomcat/tomcat-users.xml`
file under Ubuntu.

On Ubuntu the user for the administrator console is not created
automatically,
you have to add the
user entry manually to the
`/etc/tomcat7/tomcat-users.xml`. 
The following listing gives an example for a user. To get more
information try to login and see the resulting error message. Once
you entered a user and a password, restart the Tomcat server to
ensure your new users is activated.

[source,java]
----
include::res/install/user.txt[]
----

The default user for the Tomcat administration console under Windows
is
_admin_
with the
_admin_
password.

[[tomcat_deploy]]
=== Deployment

The standard deployment format for webapplications is a
`.war`
file.
If
you create a war application just put this application
into
the
`webapps`
folder. The next time tomcat starts it will unpack
the
war
and make the
application available.

Web applications may require external libraries. 
Typically, web application contain their own libraries but if you want to make certain libraries available for all applications you can put them into the folder "lib" and a subfolder below "lib". 
These libraries are then available for all web applications.
