== Modern JavaScript

JavaScript is evolving rapidly.
Initially, it was knows as a client-side scripting language, for web page manipulation, validation, and minor processing.
After the introduction of https://developers.google.com/v8/[Google's V8] and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js[Node.js], there were an increasing number of ways of using it in programming.

With its increasing importance also in backends, _JavaScript_ is now considered "The programming language for the web",
used on the _Full Stack_: Client, Server, and Middleware.
Furthermore, you can use _Modern JavaScript_ also to write applications running on Mobile, Desktop, and Containers.

Some examples of modern JavaScript usage are: Web UIs; Mobile UIs; Browser-based applications; IoT applications; large-scale real-time systems; REST-APIs services; databases; etc.

In this article, we'll introduce _Modern JavaScript_'s workflows, and tools, using Eclipse with JSDT 2.0 as main IDE.

=== JSDT 2.0 (JavaScript Development Tools)

JSDT is the Eclipse Project supporting JavaScript development, also used as base by commercial tools like JBossTools, ZendStudio, etc.

JSDT 1.x, shipped until Eclipse Mars.2, was used for _Classic_ client-side JavaScript, supporting https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript[ECMAScript] 3.0 (*ES3*, 1999).

JSDT 2.x, shipped from Eclipse Neon on, is a total reboot of the tooling, to fill existing gaps with _Modern_ JavaScript, supporting:

* ECMAScript 6 (*ES6*, 2015)
* Node.js and tools like npm, Bower, Gulp and Grunt
* Chromium debugging

==== JSDT parser/compiler infrastructure

JSDT changed several _parser/compiler_ toolchains. Below you see a brief resume:

* *JSDT 1.0*, until Mars.2: supports ES3 using https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/Rhino[Rhino] (Mozilla Foundation), a Java-based parser/compiler for JavaScript.
* *JSDT 2.0*, _initial release_: supports ES6 using http://esprima.org/[Esprima] (jQuery Foundation). As Esprima is written in JavaScript, this version of JSDT 2.0 needs to https://wiki.eclipse.org/JSDT/Equinox_hook_for_Nashorn[hook Nashorn], the Java8's JS interpreter.
* *JSDT 2.0*, _from Neon.2_ release: supports ES6 using https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/[ClosureCompiler] (Google), a java-based parsing infrastructure for JavaScript.

==== ECMAScript 6 (ES6)

JSDT 2.0 supports ECMAScript 6 (*ES6*, 2015), the most recent spec. at development time. *ES6* introduces new language features, such as Classes, default parameters, template literals, destructuring assignments (from Node.js), and much more.


[source, javascript]
----
// Class
class Smartphone extends Phone {
  constructor(name){
    super('Smart Phone')
    // ..
  }
}

// default parameters
var addRows = function(parent, nRows=10, bgColor='red'){
  // ..
}

// template literals
var welcome = `Welcome, mr. ${name} ${surname}.`
var url = `http://server.co/api/message/${id}`

// destructuring assignments
var {user,pass} = request.body
var [line1, line2, line3] = file.split('\n')
----


==== Node.js and Tools

Node.js is an increasingly popular JavaScript runtime, generally used with a variety of connected tools.

JSDT 2.0 supports running and debugging Node.js applications, using commands available in the context menu.

JSDT 2.0 also integrates common Node.js tools, as:

_Package Managers_, using JSON-based files to manage and install dependencies:

* *Npm*: used for installing _node modules_. Its nested dependency tree is generally heavy in size.
* *Bower*: for installing _frontend components_. Its "flat folder" structure avoids duplicate downloads and helps reducing page loads.

_Task runners_, to automate operations:

* *Grunt*: to configure separate independent tasks. It uses a json-based file to describe the tasks.
* *Gulp*: intuitive and fast task runner. The tasks are defined in a file with JavaScript syntax.


==== Chromium Debugging

JSDT 2.0 uses Chromium as JavaScript debugger. The code, developed as part of Google https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/[Chrome dev tools], is now EPL-licensed, and available in the JSDT repository, under the `org.eclipse.wst.jsdt.chromium` project.

More information about the adoption of the Chromium Debugger in JSDT are available in the  https://wiki.eclipse.org/JSDT/Confcalls/Minutes_JSDT_Debugger[transcription of the JSDT Confcall about the Debugger].

=== Exercise: Install Node.js and tools

To use JSDT 2.0 for the tutorials, install Node.js and tools on your system, then verify the installation is correct.

https://nodejs.org/en/download/[Download] and install Node.js on your computer. The default installation should provide both `node` and `npm` commands. Verify the installation by checking the versions of the two commands.

[source, terminal]
----
$ node -v
v4.4.5
----

[source, terminal]
----
$ npm -v
2.2.15
----

Before adding other Node.js plugins, ensure your `npm` is up-to-date, by running the below command. Note that `-g` means globally, or _system-wide_.

[source, terminal]
----
$ npm update -g npm
----

Now, install Bower, Gulp and Grunt using Npm, the Node.js package manager.
Install the modules globally, with the *-g* flag, using the commands below.

Note: in linux systems, you might need to use `sudo npm ...`

[source, terminal]
----
$ npm install -g bower
----

[source, terminal]
----
$ npm install -g grunt
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
----

[source, terminal]
----
$ npm install -g gulp
$ npm install -g gulp-cli
----

When done, check the tools are available in your system, by checking their versions via command line.

[source, terminal]
----
$ bower -v && grunt -version && gulp -version
1.7.9
grunt-cli v1.2.0
[17:18:39] CLI version 1.2.2
[17:18:39] Local version 3.9.1
----

=== Get your IDE with JSDT 2.0

JSDT 2.0 is available starting from Eclipse Neon, and is shipped either in Eclipse IDE _for Java EE Developers_, or _for JavaScript and Web Developers_.

image::get-eclipse-ide-for-jee-or-javascript-developers.png[]

In the tutorial, we will use the latest JSDT features integrated with Java EE and web development.

Download the latest version of the _Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers_
from the https://eclipse.org/downloads/eclipse-packages/[EPP download page], or from the https://eclipse.org/downloads/index-developer.php[EPP downloads for developers].

When done, unzip and launch the IDE. Then, open the Console by pressing kbd:[Ctrl+Alt+Shift+T], and type `npm -v`.

image::verify-npm-from-command-prompt.png[]

If you can read the npm version, the installation is successful,
and we can proceed creating out first Node.js application with JSDT.

=== Run a Node.js Application

Create a new _General Project_ named  `com.vogella.jsdt.test`.
Select the project, press kbd:[Ctrl+N], type `npm init`, and select the entry to create a new npm Init file.

image::new-npm-init-file.png[]

With the _npm Initialization Wizard_ you can initialize the NPM package
providing the main information for your Node.js module.

image::new-npm-init-wizard_S.png[]

When done, the wizard generates the *package.json*, which is the file describing the Node.js module packaging and information.

image::generated-package-json.png[]

In the _package.json_, we read `"main" : "index.js"`, which declares the main entry point for the module is *index.js* .
For most modules, it makes the most sense having a main script and often not too much else.

==== A simple Node.js application

Create a new file named *index.js*, the main entry point for the application, and add the content you see below.

[source, javascript]
----
/** com.vogella.jsdt.test/index.js */
var open = require('open');

// open with default browser
open('https://www.vogella.com/tutorials');
----

The program declares a dependency to the module *open*,
and uses a function of that module to open a the system default browser passing a given URL.

Test the program running it with Node.js by selecting the file, right-clicking and choosing *Run as > Node.js application*.

image::run-as-nodejs-application.png[]

After running, we'll see a console error: `Error: Cannot find module 'open'`. This is because Node.js is missing a reference to the module named "open".

==== Installing dependencies

To fix this issue, we need to add the module to the package.json dependencies and then install the dependencies by downloading them locally.

To add the missing dependency, edit manually the *package.json*,
by adding a development-time dependency to the latest version ("*") of the module "open".

[source, JSON]
----
{
  "name": "com.vogella.jsdt.test",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "JSDT test project",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo 'Error: no test specified' && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Patrik Suzzi",
  "license": "EPL",
  "devDependencies" : {
  	"open" : "*"
  }
}
----

Then, run the `npm install` using hte JSDT integration:
right click on *package.json* and select *Run As > npm Install*.

image::run-as-npm-install.png[]

As a result, you will see all the needed dependencies downloaded under the *node_modules* folder.

image::node-modules-downloaded.png[]

Now, we can run the application again, right-clicking the *index.js* and then selecting *Run As > Node.js Application*.
This time, as a result, we expect to see the Node.js instance launching the browser and opening the given webpage.
