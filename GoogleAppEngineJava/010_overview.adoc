== Google App Engine for Java (GAE/J)

[[googleappengine_overview]]
=== Overview

Google offers a cloud
computing infrastructure called
http://appengine.google.com/[Google App Engine]
(App Engine) for creating and
running
https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseWTP/article.html[web applications].

App Engine
allows the dynamic allocation of system
resources for an
application
based on the
actual demand.
Currently
App Engine
supports
https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/GoogleAppEngine/article.html[Python]
and Java based applications. This includes
Java
Virtual Machine
(JVM)
based
languages, e.g.
https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Groovy/article.html[Groovy] or
https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Scala/article.html[Scala]. 
This article will cover the App Engine for Java (GAE/J)).

[[googleappengine_standards]]
=== Standard API's via App Engine specific API's

The App Engine offers frequently standard Java API's and
App
Engine
specific API's for the same task. If you want to be able to
port your
application
from
the AppEngine to other webcontainers, e.g.
Tomcat or
Jetty, you should only use
Java standard API. 

[[googleappengine_technologies]]
=== AppEngine technologies

App Engine uses the
https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Jetty/article.html[Jetty]
servlet container to host
applications and
supports the Java Servlet
API in version 2.4. It
provides access to
databases via Java Data
Objects (JDO) and the
https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JavaPersistenceAPI/article.html[Java Persistence API (JPA)]. 
In the background App Engine uses
https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/GoogleTechnologies/article.html#bigtable Google Bigtable]
as the distributed storage system for persisting application data.

Google provides
https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/GoogleTechnologies/article.html#memcache Memcache]
as a caching mechanism. Developers who want to code against the
standard Java API can use the JCache implementation (based on JSR 107).

[[googleappengine_services]]
=== Services

The App Engine provides several services. For example the
Blobstore allows to upload and store and serve large data objects
(blobs) with a limit of  2 Gigabyte. To create a blob you
upload a file via an HTTP request.   

[[googleappengine_versions]]
=== Versions
 
Google App Engine supports the creation of several version of
your application. In the Admin Console you can select which version
should be active. Your active application "your-name" will be
accessible via the URL 

....
http://your-name.appspot.com
.... 

Each version
can also
be accessed for example to test a new version. The version
are
accessable via 

....
http://versionnumber.latest.your-name.appspot.com
....

where version is for example "2" and "latest" is a fixed string.

[[googleappengine_restrictions]]
=== Restrictions

App Engine runs a version of Java 6 but does not provide all
Java
classes, for example
Swing
and most AWT classes
are not
supported. 

You cannot use https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JavaConcurrency/article.html[Threads] or frameworks which uses Threads. You
can also not write to the filesystem and only read files which are
part of your application. Certain "java.lang.System" actions, e.g. gc()
or exit() will do nothing. You can not call JNI code. Reflection
is possible for your own classes and standard Java classes but your
cannot use reflection to access other classes outside your
application.  

See http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/jrewhitelist.html[Java Whitelist for a full list of supported classes].

A servlet needs also to reply within 30 seconds otherwise a "com.google.apphosting.api.DeadlineExceededException" is thrown. 

[[googleappengine_quotes]]
=== Quotas

Google offers free hosting for websites which are not highly
frequented, e.g. 5 Millions page views. The price model for the
websites that exceed thier daily quota is listed on the
http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/billing.html[Google billing documentation pages]. 
The usage quotas
of the App Engine are constantly changing but, at
the time of this
writing, are around 5 millions pages views per month,
which translates
approx. in 6.5 CPU hours and 1 gigabyte of outbound
traffic.

Currently a user can create a maximum of 10 applications on the
Google App Engine. The user can delete existing application in the
Admin Console under Application Settings.
