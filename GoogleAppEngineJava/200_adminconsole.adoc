[[adminconsole_overview]]
=== Overview

The Admin Console provides you with a lot of information about your application. 
For example you can acces the data stored in the datastore or look at the log files of your application.

You can also use standard Java Logging for creating custom logs on
the
GAE/J. See
https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Logging/article.html[Java Logging Tutorial]
and
http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/runtime.html#Logging[Logging on the GAE/J].

[[adminconsole_extend]]
=== Extend the Admin Console

You can also extend the admin console with own pages. Create
the following entry in "appengine-web.xml". 

[source,text]
----
include::res/admin/extend.txt[]
----

We will just use a static HTML for the example. Create the following file in the `WEB-INF` folder. 

[source,text]
----
include::res/admin/static.html[]
----

If you redeploy your application you have another entry in your Admin console.
