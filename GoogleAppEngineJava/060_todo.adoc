[[todo]]
== Developing a task management web application

[[todo_overview]]
=== Overview

In the following exercise zou create a web app for a task management system using servlets and JSP's. 
The persistence will be handled by https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JavaPersistenceAPI/article.html[JPA]. 
For an introduction into servlet please see https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseWTP/article.html[Servlet and JSP development - Tutorial].

[[todo_project]]
=== Project

Create a new project called `com.vogella.gae.java.todo` via menu:File[New > Web Application Project]. 
Package name is also `com.vogella.gae.java.todo`.

The created project can already run. Right-click on your application, select menu:run as[Web Application].

This should start Jetty on 

....
http://localhost:8888/
....
 
Open the url in the browser and you should the possibility to select your servlet and to start it. 
If you select it you should see a "Hello, world" message.

[[todo_model]]
=== Create your model

Create the following class which will be our model. 
The https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JavaPersistenceAPI/article.html[JPA] metadata is already added.

[source,java]
----
include::res/model/Todo.java[]
----

[[todo_jpa]]
=== Setup JPA and your DAO

To use JPA in your project you must create the JPA configuration
file "persistence.xml" in the "META-INF" directory. This file
contains
the configuration that tells JPA to use the App Engine
datastore.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/jpa/persistence.xml[]
----

The creation of the EntityManagerFactory is time-consuming
therefore we buffer it.

[source,java]
----
include::res/jpa/EMFService.java[]
----

The following class provides the possibility to query for all todos and to add and delete todos.

[source,java]
----
include::res/jpa/Dao.java[]
----

[[todo_servlets]]
=== Create servlets

Create the following two servlets. 
The first will be called if a new Todo is created the second one if a Todo is finished.

[source,java]
----
include::res/servlet/ServletCreateTodo.java[]
----

[source,java]
----
include::res/servlet/ServletRemoveTodo.java[]
----

[[todo_jsp]]
=== Create JSP

In the folder "war" create the following JSP "TodoApplication.jsp".

[source,text]
----
include::res/jsp/TodoApplication.jsp[]
----

The JSP refers to a css file. Create a folder "war/css" and create the following file "main.css".

[source,text]
----
include::res/jsp/main.css[]
----

[[todo_web]]
=== web.xml

Change
`web.xml`
in folder /war/WEB-INF" to the following. It
will create the right
servlet mapping and will set the JSP as start
page.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/servlet/web.xml[]
----

[[todo_runagain]]
=== Run your application again

You should be able to run your application locally, login and create and delete "Todos".

[[todo_application]]
=== Maintain application

To deploy your application to the GAE you need to maintain your
application ID in the file "web/WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml". In the
tag "application" maintain the application you have created in
https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/GoogleAppEngineJava/article.html#register[GAE/J Registration]. 
In my example I use the application "vogellatodo".

[source,xml]
----
include::res/conf/appengine-web.xml[]
----

[[todo_deploy]]
=== Deploy your application

Now deploy your application to the Google cloud. 
The following assumes that you have already created your account.

Right-click on your project and select Google > App
Engine
Settings... from the context menu. Check that the application ID is
as you maintained it in "appengine-web.xml".

image::gae30.png[]

Right-click on your project, Select Google -> Deploy to App Engine.
You need to login with your Google account information.

After the upload completes you will find your application online under

....
http://application-id.appspot.com
....

e.g. in my case

....
http://vogellatodo.appspot.com.
