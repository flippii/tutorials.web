== Google App Engine for Java (GAE/J)
[[googleappengine_overview">
=== Overview
		
			Google offers a cloud
			computing infrastructure called
http://appengine.google.com/"> Google App Engine]
			(App Engine) for creating and
			running
http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseWTP/article.html">web applications]
			.
			App Engine
			allows the dynamic allocation of system
			resources for an
			application
			based on the
			actual demand.
			Currently
			App Engine
			supports
http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/GoogleAppEngine/article.html">Python]
			and Java based applications. This includes
			Java
			Virtual Machine
			(JVM)
			based
			languages, e.g.
http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Groovy/article.html"> Groovy]
			or
http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Scala/article.html"> Scala]
			. This article will cover the App Engine for Java (GAE/J)).
		


[[googleappengine_standards">
=== Standard API's via App Engine specific API's
		
			The App Engine offers frequently standard Java API's and
			App
			Engine
			specific API's for the same task. If you want to be able to
			port your
			application
			from
			the AppEngine to other webcontainers, e.g.
			Tomcat or
			Jetty, you should only use
			Java standard API. 
		

[[googleappengine_technologies">
=== AppEngine technologies
		
			App Engine uses the
http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Jetty/article.html">Jetty]
			servlet container to host
			applications and
			supports the Java Servlet
			API in version 2.4. It
			provides access to
			databases via Java Data
			Objects (JDO) and the
http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JavaPersistenceAPI/article.html"> Java Persistence API (JPA)]
			. In the background App Engine uses
http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/GoogleTechnologies/article.html#bigtable"> Google Bigtable]
			as the distributed storage system for persisting application data.
		
		
			Google provides
http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/GoogleTechnologies/article.html#memcache"> Memcache]
			as a caching mechanism. Developers who want to code against the
			standard Java API can use the JCache implementation (based on JSR
			107).
		

[[googleappengine_services">
=== Services
		 The App Engine provides several services. For example the
			Blobstore allows to upload and store and serve large data objects
			(blobs) with a limit of  2 Gigabyte. To create a blob you
			upload a file via an HTTP request.   

[[googleappengine_versions">
=== Versions
		 Google App Engine supports the creation of several version of
			your application. In the Admin Console you can select which version
			should be active. Your active application "your-name" will be
			accessible via the URL "http://your-name.appspot.com". Each version
			can also
			be accessed for example to test a new version. The version
			are
			accessable via "http://versionnumber.latest.your-name.appspot.com"
			where version is for example "2" and "latest" is a fixed string.
		

[[googleappengine_restrictions">
=== Restrictions

		
			App Engine runs a version of Java 6 but does not provide all
			Java
			classes, for example
			Swing
			and most AWT classes
			are not
			supported. 
			

		 You cannot use http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JavaConcurrency/article.html">Threads] or frameworks which uses Threads. You
			can also not write to the filesystem and only read files which are
			part of your application. Certain "java.lang.System" actions, e.g. gc()
			or exit() will do nothing. You can not call JNI code. Reflection
			is possible for your own classes and standard Java classes but your
			cannot use reflection to access other classes outside your
			application.  
		
			See

http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/jrewhitelist.html"> Java Whitelist for
				a full
				list
				of
				supported
				classes.]
		
		 A servlet needs also to reply within 30 seconds otherwise a
			"com.google.apphosting.api.DeadlineExceededException" is thrown. 	


[[googleappengine_quotes">
=== Quotas
		

			Google offers free hosting for websites which are not highly
			frequented, e.g. 5 Millions page views. The price model for the
			websites that exceed thier daily quota is listed on the
http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/billing.html"> Google billing
				documentation pages]
			. The usage quotas
			of the App Engine are constantly changing but, at
			the time of this
			writing, are around 5 millions pages views per month,
			which translates
			approx. in 6.5 CPU hours and 1 gigabyte of outbound
			traffic.
		

		 Currently a user can create a maximum of 10 applications on the
			Google App Engine. The user can delete existing application in the
			Admin Console under Application Settings.
