== Persistence with JPA

GAE/J supports https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JavaPersistenceAPI/article.html[JPA] (Java Persistence API) 1.0 for persisting data. 
As all data on the GAE/J is stored in Bigtable some features of JPA are not supported. 
See https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/datastore/jpa/overview[JPA on GAE/J] for details.
Alternatively to JPA you can also use JDO or the low-level API of the App Engine. 
The datastorage facility is described in http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/datastore/overview.html[Datastore Java API Overview].
