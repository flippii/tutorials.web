== Exercise: Spring Cloud Config client

Different micro services, e.g., _com.vogella.spring.user_,
should now get their configuration from the Config Server rather than holding their own configuration.

The _application.properties_ file can be deleted from the _com.vogella.spring.user_ project.
Instead of using the _application.properties_ a _bootstrap.properties_ now has to be added to the `src/main/resources` folder.

[source, properties, title="bootstrap.properties"]
----
spring.application.name=user <1>
spring.cloud.config.uri=http://localhost:8888 <2>
management.security.enabled=false <3>
----

<1> Besides Eureka, also the Cloud Config Server makes use of this property to find the right config file in the git repo 
<2> Tells this Config Server client where to find the Config Server
<3> Disable security right now for convenience, but it will be added again later ;-)

In order to enable the user project to talk to a Cloud Config Server the
`implementation('org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-config')` dependency has to be added to the _build.gradle_ file.

IMPORTANT: Do not forget to refresh the Gradle project.

Now start the Eureka Server, the Config Server and finally the user server.

Look into the console log of the user application and validate that the remote properties in the git repo have been used.
