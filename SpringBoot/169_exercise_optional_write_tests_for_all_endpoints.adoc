== Optional Exercise: Write tests for the rest of the endpoints


Implement tests for the rest of the endpoints.
Try to consider the happy path as well as the possible failures and invalid inputs.

For example:

* `POST /user/search` should return status 400 if the given json can't be mapped to user
* `DELETE /user/{id}` should return status 404 if the id is not valid
* `DELETE /user/{id}` should return status 204 if a user was successfully deleted
