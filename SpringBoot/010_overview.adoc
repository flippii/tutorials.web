== Spring Boot

`Spring Boot` is an opinionated framework built on top the `Spring Framework`.
You can find out more about the Spring framework and its modules in our http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Spring/article.html[Spring tutorial].

While Spring is very powerful and gives you many choices it can also require a lot of manual configuration.
Spring Boot aims to be highly productive by providing default configuration for most features while still giving you the ability to easily change the behavior according to your needs.

Spring Boot is mostly used to create web application but can also be used for command line applications.
A Spring Boot web application can be built to a stand-alone jar with an embedded web server that can be started with `java -jar`.
Spring Boot makes it easy to integrate the various Spring modules into your application through starter POMs that contain all necessary dependencies, which get auto configured.

== Example Spring Boot Application

We will create our first Spring Boot application with the `Spring Tool Suite`, a powerful editor based on the Eclipse IDE.
You can download it from its https://spring.io/tools/sts[Spring project website].

Once you have started the Spring Tool Suite click on menu:File[New > Spring Starter Project] to open the project creation wizard.
For the purpose of this example we'll choose a Gradle based project with the web starter dependency.

Alternatively you can create your project directly with the https://start.spring.io/[online wizard] and import it into your favorite IDE.

Three folders were automatically created `src/main/java`, `src/main/resources` and `src/main/test. 
`src/main/java` will be used to save all java source files, `src/main/resources` will be used for templates and any other files and `src/main/test` will be used for tests.

Open your project and create a new controller class named `HelloWorldController.java` in the `com.vogella.example` package of the `src/main/java` folder:

[source, java]
----
package com.vogella.example;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ResponseBody;

@Controller
public class HelloWorldController {
	
    @RequestMapping("/")
    @ResponseBody
    String index() {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }

}
----

Now start the class `DemoApplication` as a `Spring Boot App`.
The embedded Tomcat server starts listening on port 8080.
When you point your browser to `http://localhost:8080` you should see the welcome message:
