== Optional Exercise: Write mocks for all endpoint tests

If you've done the earlier optional exercise *Write tests for the rest of the endpoints* you still have some tests that fail because of the missing UserService.
If you haven't completed the earlier exercise go ahead and do it now.

Write mocks for all test methods you've implemented to make them pass again.
