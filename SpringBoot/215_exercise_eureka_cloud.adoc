== Exercise: Create a Netflix Eureka server

Create a new Spring project called _com.vogella.spring.eureka_.

Press btn:[Next] and add the _Eureka Server_ dependency(_'org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-eureka-server'_) and then press finish.

When the project is created the `@EnableEurekaServer` annotation has to be added the application config.

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableEurekaServer
public class Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }
}
----

And these would be the default _application.yml_ for the Eureka server.

[source, yml]
----
server:
  port: 8761
eureka:
  client:
    registerWithEureka: false
    fetchRegistry: false
----

Now you can navigate to http://localhost:8761 with a browser and see the Eureka dashboard and the services, which have been discovered.

You should now (re-)start the user server and then see the user service in the Eureka dashboard:
