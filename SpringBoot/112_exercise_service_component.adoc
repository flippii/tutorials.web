== Exercise: @Component and @Service annotations

Create a _com.vogella.di_ package inside the _com.vogella.di project.
This package should contain an interface called `Beer`.

[source,java]
----
package com.vogella.playground;

public interface Beer {
	String getName();
}
----

Then create a class called `Flensburger`, which represents a beer instance.

[source,java]
----
@Component
public class Flensburger implements Beer {

	@Override
	public String getName() {
		return "Flensburger";
	}

}
----

Now a beer instance can be injected into another class, which deserves a beer.

LetÂ´s say we have a service called `BarKeeperService`, which can do something with the beer.

[source,java]
----
@Service
public class BarKeeperService {

	Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(BarKeeperService.class);

	private Beer beer;

	public BarKeeperService(Beer beer) {
		this.beer = beer;
	}

	public void logBeerName() {
		LOG.info("Barkeeper serves " + beer.getName());
	}
}
----

Now go into the `Application` class and inject the `BarKeeperService` via method injection by using the `@Autowired` annotation.

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
	}

	@Autowired
	public void setBeerService(BarKeeperService beerService) {
		beerService.logBeerName();
	}
}
----

Now you can run the application and see _Barkeeper serves Flensburger_ in the logs.
