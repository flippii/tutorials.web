== Exercise - Making the information available via REST

If you want to access your data from another application or make it available for the public your best and most secure way is a REST api. Luckily the SpringBoot framework has useful methods for this. 

=== Setup

Create a new class named `ApiController`. You may create a new package for this or use the existing `com.vogella.example.controller` package. To tell Spring that this is a RestController and that the methods inside this controller should return JSON data, add the `@RestController` annotation to the class. 

The setup for the routes is similar to normal routes. 
Use the `@GetMapping` for `GET` requests. And `@PostMapping` for `POST` requests. 
The difference is that this time you don't want templates to be rendered. So the return type for the methods should be whatever you want to return. E.g. `IssueReport` or even `List<IssueReport>`.

[source, java]
----
	@GetMapping("/api/issues")
	public List<IssueReport> getIssues() {
	
	}
	
	@GetMapping("/api/issues/{id}")
	public IssueReport getIssue(@PathVariable(value="id") long id) {
		
	}
----

If you want to access a variable in the URL (in this case `id`) you do this by first declaring it a variable in the `@GetMapping` arguments (`{id}`). Than you require it as a method parameter with the `@PathVariable` annotation.

=== YXX

Accessing the data is pretty easy too. Just (re-)use the previously created `IssueRepository` and return the values from the methods in there.

[source, java]
----
	@Autowired
	IssueRepository issueRepository;
	
	@GetMapping("/api/issues")
	public List<IssueReport> getIssues() {
		return this.issueRepository.findAllButPrivate();
	}
	
	@GetMapping("/api/issues/{id}")
	public IssueReport getIssue(@PathVariable(value="id") long id) {
		return this.issueRepository.findOne(id);
	}
----

Again the `IssueRepository` is automatically injected into the class. You can still use the custom query method `findAllButPrivate(...)`. 

The method `findOne(long id)` queries only the object with the given Id. In this case we get it from the URL parameters and then we return the object queried or (in case nothing is found) nothing.
