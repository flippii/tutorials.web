== Exercise: `@SpringBootTest`

Execute the tests in `UserRestControllerTest` again.
You'll find that they break because of the introduction of the `UserService`.
The RestController now needs the UserService as an collaborator but since our test only loads the web slice for the UserRestController it's not available.

One easy way to get around this it to transform the test into an intergration test that loads the full Spring application.
This is slower but ensures that the UserService is available for injection.

Create a new class called `UserRestControllerIntegrationTest` with the `@SpringBootTest` annotation and paste in the tests from `UserRestController`:

[source, java]
----
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest
public class UserRestControllerIntegrationTest {
       // test code copied from UserRestController..
}
----

The tests should all pass then.
