== Exercise: Let the gateway find services load balanced

Now that we are able to add services to the Eureka server, we no longer want to address services via its physical address, but by service name.

So instead of pointing to the user server by using _http://localhost:8081_ with the `RouteLocator` in the gateway project a different _uri_ can be used.

[source,java]
----
package com.vogella.spring.gateway;

import org.springframework.cloud.client.discovery.EnableDiscoveryClient;
import org.springframework.cloud.gateway.route.RouteLocator;
import org.springframework.cloud.gateway.route.builder.RouteLocatorBuilder;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
@EnableDiscoveryClient <1>
public class RouteConfig {
	@Bean
	public RouteLocator customRouteLocator(RouteLocatorBuilder builder) {
		return builder.routes()
				.route("users", r -> r.path("/user/**")
				.uri("lb://user")) <2>
				.build();
	}
}

----

<1> The gateway itself has also to be registered to eureka to make it work properly
<2> lb stands for load balanced

Load balanced means that Eureka can now decide to which user service instance it passes the request, in case several user service instances are running.

The _application.properties_ of the gateway project have to look like this:

[source, properties]
----
server.port=8080
spring.application.name=gateway <1>

spring.cloud.gateway.discovery.locator.enabled=true <2>
spring.cloud.gateway.discovery.locator.lower-case-service-id=true <3>
----
<1> Service name in the eureka registry
<2> The discovery locator has to be enabled to make the `RouteLocator` work 
<3> By default services are written with upper case letters and this setting allows lower case

Now three server should be started: Eureka server with Spring Cloud Cli, Gateway server and the User server. 

When navigating to the http://localhost:8080/user end point the same result as before should be returned as response.

The big benefit is that it is now possible to start several user server on different ports and eureka will load balance the requests.
