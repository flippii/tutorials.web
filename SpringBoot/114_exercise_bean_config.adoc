== Exercise: @Configuration and @Bean annotation

A `@Configuration` class can be used to configure your beans programmatically.
So now we create a class called `BeerConfig`, which is capable of creating beer instances/beans.

[source,java]
----
package com.vogella.playground.di;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
public class BeerConfig {
	
	@Bean
	public Beer getBecks() {
		return new Beer() {
			@Override
			public String getName() {
				return "Becks";
			}
		};
	}
}
----

Now try to start the application and figure out what went wrong.

Then add the `@Primary` annotation to whatever beer you like most and rerun the application, which should now print your primary beer.

[TIP]
====
The `@Primary` annotation can be placed below or above `@Bean` or `@Component` depending on the place you need it.

NOTE: Do not forget to press kbd:[CTRL + SHIFT + O] to organize the import of the `org.springframework.context.annotation.Primary` annotation.
