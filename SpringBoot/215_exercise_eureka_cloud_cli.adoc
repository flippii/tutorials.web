== Exercise: Start Eureka server with Spring Cloud Cli

In a previous exercise the spring cloud cli has been installed.

By running `spring cloud --list` in the command line available cloud services can be found.

Besides others _eureka_ is listed as well.

In order to start it you can run `spring cloud eureka` in the command line.

Once the eureka server has been started it prints the following to the command line:

[source, console]
----
eureka: To see the dashboard open http://localhost:8761

Type Ctrl-C to quit.
----

[NOTE]
====
Starting the eureka server with Spring Cloud CLI may take awail.
Just be patient or try to create a new Spring Boot project, which is described in the next NOTE of this exercise.
====

Now you can navigate to http://localhost:8761 with a browser and see the Eureka dashboard and the services, which have been discovered.

You should now (re-)start the user server and then see the user service in the Eureka dashboard:

[NOTE]
====
In case you do not want to use the Spring Cloud CLI you can easily create a Eureka server own your own by creating a new Spring Boot project.
Add the Netflix Eureka Server depenedency (_'org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-eureka-server'_) and add the `@EnableEurekaServer` annotation to the application config.

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableEurekaServer
public class Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }
}
----

And these would be the default _application.yml_ for the Eureka server:

[source, yml]
----
server:
  port: 8761
eureka:
  client:
    registerWithEureka: false
    fetchRegistry: false
----
