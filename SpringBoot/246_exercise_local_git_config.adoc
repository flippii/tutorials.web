== Exercise: Local Git Repository with configurations

Create your own local git repository and provide a _user.properties_ for the configuration in the git repository.

[source, console]
----
mkdir config

git init

echo 'server.port=8081' > user.properties

git add .

git commit -m "Added user config"
----

Now the Cloud Config Server can point to the local repository.

[source, properties]
----
server.port=8888
spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri=file://${path-to-repo} <1>
----

<1> ${path-to-repo} has to be replaced by the actual path to the previously created repo

Now again start the Eureka Server, the Config Server and finally the user server.

Look into the console log of the user application and validate that the remote properties in the git repo have been used.
