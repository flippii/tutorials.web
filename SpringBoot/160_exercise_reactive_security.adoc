== Exercise: Add Spring Security to the classpath

To ensure that not everyone can read any todo the rest end point should be secured.

To achieve this the `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-security` compile dependency has to be added.

[source,groovy]
----

dependencies {

	// more dependencies ...
	
	compile('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-security')
}
----

Spring Boot automatically adds default security settings to the web application by adding this dependency.

Again try to get all todos by navigating to http://localhost:8080/getTodos in the browser.

Now you should be redirected to http://localhost:8080/login and being faced with a login page.

The default user is called _user_ and the password can be found in the console.
