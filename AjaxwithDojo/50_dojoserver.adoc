== Accessing the server

=== Reading a fixed file from a server

Dojo allows you to read data from the server. 
The following HTML page will connect the server and asynchronously load the content from the web server. 
In this example the loaded content is a static text page.

[source,text]
----
include::res/server/readServer.html[]
----

TIP: This example may not be running on a local file system.
If you do not see something try to replace the URL https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/AjaxwithDojo/download/includeTextFile.txt with a path to a local file. 
This should then also work with a local running HTML page.

Start the HTML. The Dojo javascript will access the text file in the background and update the webpage with the information once the text file is read.

Welcome to the world of Ajax! You successfully loaded a content from a website and included the response into your existing HTML page.

=== Send data to the server and update the page with the response

Now you need a build a server side application. 
I'm going to use Java Servlets for this but you can use any other language on the server you like, e.g. Perl, PHP, etc.

Create the following Java servlet, compile it and deploy it to your server. 
I'm going to assume that the servlet will be running on the URL yourhomepage/servlets/ReturnParameters.

[source,text]
----
include::res/server/ReturnParameters.java[]
----

Now create the following HTML page which calls the servlet with two parameters and displays the result at a certain place in the application.

[source,text]
----
include::res/server/paratoServlet.html[]
