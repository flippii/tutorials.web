== Required setup for Gradle and Eclipse web projects

This section describes how to setup Eclipse WTP in a Gradle project.
This is required for the following tutorials.

=== Prerequisites

Make sure that you followed the https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseWTP/article.html#installation-of-wtp[Eclipse WTP Tutorial] to install Eclipse WTP.

Make also sure that you followed the https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseGradle/article.html[Eclipse Buildship Tutorial] to enable Gradle support for Eclipse.

If you have not yet created a Gradle project, you can follow the Buildship tutorial to create one.

=== Gradle setup

Open the _build.gradle_ file and add the following two lines. 

[source,xml]
----
include::res/gradle/build.gradle_plugins[]
----

Since we want to create a web application, we want a _war_ file (and not a _jar_ file which would be created by Gradle with the _Java_ plugin).
The _eclipse-wtp_ plugin helps you to generate the _Eclipse WTP_ project files.

Now, add a new folder with the name _WebContent_ to your projects root. 
To do so, menu:right click on the projects name[New > Folder]. 
Add another folder with the name _WEB-INF_ to your _WebContent_ folder.

The next step is to add a xml file with the name _web.xml_ to the created _WEB-INF_ folder.
To do so menu: right click on the created folder name[New > Other...] and select _XML file_.

Your folder structure should now look something like this:

Now the newly created folders with the _web.xml_ in it has to be added to the _build.gradle_ file by adding the following line:

[source,xml]
----
include::res/gradle/build.gradle_webapp[]
----

Perform a right-click on the project and select menu:Gradle[Refresh Gradle Project...].
This will add various new tasks to your _Gradle Tasks_ view.

Run the _eclipseWTP_ task to generate the _Eclipse WTP_ project files and finish the project setup.
