=== Required setup for Gradle with Eclipse web projects

==== Prerequisites

Make sure that you followed the http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseWTP/article.html#installation-of-wtp[Eclipse WTP Tutorial] to install Eclipse WTP.

Make also sure that you followed the http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseGradle/article.html[Eclipse Buildship Tutorial] to enable gradle support for Eclipse.

Follow the tutorial to create a blank gradle project with the name _com.vogella.jersey.first_ within Eclipse and add a new default package to _src/main/java_ with the name _com.vogella.jersey.first_.


==== Gradle setup

Open the _build.gradle_ file and replace the line _apply plugin: 'java'_ with the following two lines:

[source,xml]
----
include::res/gradle/build.gradle_plugins[]
----

Since we want to create a web application, we want a _war_ file and not a _jar_ file (which would be created by gradle with the _Java_ plugin).

The _eclipse-wtp_ plugin will later help you to generate the _Eclipse WTP_ project files.

Next, add the following dependency to your _build.gradle_ to add the _Jersey_ implementation to your project:

[source,xml]
----
include::res/gradle/build.gradle_dependency[]
----

Now, add a new folder with the name _WebContent_ to your projects root. 
To do so menu:right click on the projects name[New > Folder]. 

Add another folder with the name _WEB-INF_ to your _WebContent_ folder.

The next step is to add a xml file with the name _web.xml_ to the created _WEB-INF_ folder.
To do so menu: right click on the created folder name[New > Other...] and select _XML file_.

Your folder structure should now look like this:

Now the newly created folders with the _web.xml_ in it has to be added to the _build.gradle_ file by adding the following line:

[source,xml]
----
include::res/gradle/build.gradle_webapp[]
----


Perform a right-click on the project and select menu:Gradle[Refresh Gradle Project...].

This will add various new tasks to your _Gradle Tasks_ view.

Run the _eclipseWTP_ task to generate the _Eclipse WTP_ project files and finish the project setup.
