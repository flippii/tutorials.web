== CRUD RESTful webservice

This section creates a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) restful web service. 
It will allow to maintain a list of TODOs in your web application via HTTP calls.

[[crud_project]]
=== Project

Create a new Gradle project called _com.vogella.jersey.todo_ with _com.vogella.jersey.todo_ as top-level package name.
Add the following to dependency to your build.gradle file and make also sure, that you enabled Eclipse WTP support by following <<projectsetup>>.

[source,xml]
----
compile 'org.glassfish.jersey.containers:jersey-container-servlet:2.25.1'
compile 'javax.servlet:javax.servlet-api:4.0.0-b07'
----

Change the `web.xml` file to the following.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/todo/web.xml[]
----

Create the following data model and a https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/DesignPatternSingleton/article.html[Singleton] which serves as the data provider for the model. 
We use the implementation based on an enumeration. 
Please see the link for details. 
The `Todo` class is annotated with a JAXB annotation. 
See https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JavaXML/article.html[Java and XML] to learn about JAXB.

[source,java]
----
include::res/todo/Todo.java[]
----

[source,java]
----
include::res/todo/TodoDao.java[]
----

[[crud_webpage]]
=== Create a simple HTML form

The REST service can be used via HTML forms. 
The following HTML form will allow to post new data to the service. 
Create the following page called `create_todo.html` in the `WebContent` folder.

[source,html]
----
include::res/todo/create_todo.html[]
----

[[crud_class]]
=== Rest Service

Create the following classes which will be used as REST resources.

[source,java]
----
include::res/todo/TodoResource.java[]
----

[source,java]
----
include::res/todo/TodosResource.java[]
----

This TodosResource uses the `@PathParam` annotation to define that the `id` is inserted as parameter.

[[crud_run]]
=== Run

Run your web application in Eclipse and test the availability of your REST service under: 

....
http://localhost:8080/com.vogella.jersey.todo/rest/todos
....

You should see the XML representation of your TODO items.

To see the count of TODO items use

....
http://localhost:8080/com.vogella.jersey.todo/rest/todos/count
....

to see an existing TODO use

....
http://localhost:8080/com.vogella.jersey.todo/rest/todos/{id}", e.g.,
http://localhost:8080/com.vogella.jersey.todo/rest/todos/1
....

to see the TODO with ID `1`. 
We currently have only TODOs with the ids 1 and 2, all other requests will result in an HTTP error code.

Please note that with the browser you can only issue HTTP GET requests. 
The next chapter will use the Jersey client libraries to issue get, post and delete.

[[crud_client]]
=== Create a client

To test your service you can create a new class in your server project. 
This project has already all required libs in the classpath, so this is faster than creating a new project.

Create the following class.

[source,java]
----
include::res/todo/Tester.java[]
----

[[crud_html]]
=== Using the REST service via HTML page

The above example contains a form which calls a post method of your rest service.
