[[webcontainer]]
== Web container

For this tutorial you can use any web container, for example Tomcat or the Google App Engine.

If you want to use Tomcat as servlet container please see http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseWTP/article.html[Eclipse WTP] and http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/ApacheTomcat/article.html[Apache Tomcat] for instructions on how to install and use Eclipse WTP and Apache Tomcat.

Alternative you could also use the http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/GoogleAppEngineJava/article.html[Google App Engine] for running the server part of the following REST examples. 
If you use the Google App Engine, you do not have to install and configure Tomcat.

TIP: If you are using GAE/J, you have to create App Engine projects instead of _Dynamic Web Project_. 
The following description is based on Apache Tomcat.
