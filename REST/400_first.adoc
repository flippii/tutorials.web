[[firstjersey_libraries]]
=== Configure jersey usage

See <<jerseyprojectsetup>> for the setup.

[[firstjersey_class]]
=== Java Class

Create the following class.

[source,java]
----
include::res/first/Hello.java[]
----

This class
register itself as a get
resource via the
`@GET`
annotation.
Via the
`@Produces`
annotation it
defines that it delivers
the
_text_
and the
_HTML_
MIME types. It also defines via the
`@Path`
annotation that its service
is available under the
`hello`
URL.

The browser will always request the HTML MIME type. To see the
text
version, you can use tool like
http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Ubuntu/article.html#network_curl[curl].

[[first_servletdispatcher]]
=== Define Jersey Servlet dispatcher

You need to register Jersey as the servlet dispatcher for REST
requests. Open the file
`web.xml`
and modify it to the following.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/first/web.xml[]
----

The
parameter
`jersey.config.server.provider.packages`
defines in
which
package Jersey will look for the web service classes.
This
property must point to your resources
classes. The URL pattern
defines the part of the base URL your application will be placed.

[[first_run]]
=== Run your rest service

Run you web application in Eclipse. See
http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseWTP/article.html[Eclipse WTP]
for details on how to run dynamic web applications.

You should be able to access your resources under the following
URL:

....
http://localhost:8080/com.vogella.jersey.first/rest/hello
....

image::jerseryfirstresult80.png[Result of the Jersey service]

This name
is
derived from the "display-name" defined in the
`web.xml`
file,
augmented with the servlet-mapping URL-pattern and the
`hello`
`@Path`
annotation from your class file.
You
should get
the message "Hello
Jersey".

The browser requests the HTML representation of your resource.
In the next chapter we are going to write a client
which will read
the XML representation.
