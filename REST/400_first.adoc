[[firstjersey]]
== Create your first RESTful Webservice

[[firstjersey_project]]
=== Create a new Gradle project and configure jersey usage and Eclipse WTP

Create a new Gradle project named _com.vogella.jersey.first_ with _com.vogella.jersey.first_ as the top-level package name and configure Eclipse WTP.
You can follow <<projectsetup>> to get started.

To import the Jersey dependencies, add the following dependency to your build.gradle file.

[source,text]
----
compile 'org.glassfish.jersey.containers:jersey-container-servlet:2.25.1'
----

[[firstjersey_class]]
=== Java Class

Create the following class.

[source,java]
----
include::res/first/Hello.java[]
----

This class register itself as a get resource via the `@GET` annotation.
Via the `@Produces` annotation it defines that it delivers the _text_ and the _HTML_ MIME types.
It also defines via the `@Path` annotation that its service is available under the `hello` URL.

The browser will always request the HTML MIME type.
To see the text version, you can use tool like https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Ubuntu/article.html#network_curl[curl].

[[first_servletdispatcher]]
=== Define Jersey Servlet dispatcher

You need to register Jersey as the servlet dispatcher for REST requests.

Open the file `web.xml` and modify it to the following.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/first/web.xml[]
----

The parameter `jersey.config.server.provider.packages` defines in which package Jersey will look for the web service classes.
This property must point to your resources classes.
The URL pattern defines the part of the base URL your application will be placed.

[[first_run]]
=== Run your rest service

To run your web application in Eclipse, make sure to run the gradle task `eclipseWtp` first.
Afterwards, you should be able to run the application by menu:right click on the projects name[Run As > Run on Server] 

You should be able to access your resources under the following URL:

....
http://localhost:8080/com.vogella.jersey.first/rest/hello
....

image::jerseryfirstresult80.png[Result of the Jersey service]

This URL is derived from the _context root_ value in the projects properties _Web Project Settings_ (by default, this is your application name), augmented with the servlet-mapping URL-pattern and the `hello` `@Path` annotation from your class file.
You should get the message "Hello Jersey".

As we are using Gradle, if you want to update the context root include the following in your build.gradle and update your web container (menu:right click on server[Publish] in the _Servers_ Eclipse View).

[source,java]
----
eclipse {
	wtp {
    	component {
      		contextPath = 'newName'
    	}
	}
}
----

The browser requests the HTML representation of your resource.
In the next chapter we are going to write a client which will read the XML representation.
