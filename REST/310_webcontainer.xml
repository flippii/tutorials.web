== Web container
	For this tutorial you can use any web container, for example
		Tomcat or the Google App Engine.
	
	
		If you want to use Tomcat
		as servlet container please see
		http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseWTP/article.html[Eclipse WTP]
		and
		http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/ApacheTomcat/article.html[Apache Tomcat]
		for instructions on how to install and use Eclipse WTP and Apache
		Tomcat.
	
	
		Alternative you could also use the
http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/GoogleAppEngineJava/article.html[Google App Engine]
		for running the server part of the following REST examples. If you
		use
		the Google App Engine, you do not have to install and configure
		Tomcat.
	
	<tip>
		
			If you
			are
			using GAE/J, you have to create App Engine projects
			instead
			of
			_Dynamic Web Project_
			. The following description is based on Apache Tomcat.
