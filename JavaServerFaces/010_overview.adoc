== JavaServer Faces - JSF

[[jsf_overview]]
=== What is JSF

JavaServer Faces (JSF) is a UI component based Java Web
application
framework. JSF is serverbased, e.g. the JSF UI components
and their
state
are represented on the server with a defined life cycle
of
the UI components. JSF  is part of
the Java EE standard.

A JSF application run in a
standard web
container, for example
https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/ApacheTomcat/article.html[Tomcat] or
https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Jetty/article.html[Jetty].

This articles provides an introduction to JSF using only standard JSF
features.
For the usage of special Apache Trinidad features please see
https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/ApacheMyFaces/article.html[Apache Myfaces Trinidad with Eclipse - Tutorial].

[[jsf_application]]
=== A JSF application

A JSF application consists of web pages with JSF UI components.
A JSF application requires also some configuration files
("faces-config.xml" and
`web.xml`). 

The faces-config.xml defines:

* Managed Bean - the data elements of the JSF application (managed beans and backing beans) represent a Java class which will be created dynamically during runtime of the JSF application. 
It can be defined for which scope the bean is valid (Session, Request, Application or none)

* the navigation between web pages    

* data validators - Used to check the validity of UI input

* data converters -Used to translate between UI and model

Managed beans are
simple Java objects (POJO's) which are
declared
in
"faces-config.xml"
and can be used in an JSF application.
For example
you can define a
Java object "Person". Once you define the
object in
faces-config.xml
you can use the attributes of Person in your
JSF UI
components, e.g.
by binding the value "firstName" of this object
to an
JSF input
field.

JSF uses the Unified Expression Language (EL) to bind UI
components to object attributes or methods. 

[[jsf_valuebinding]]
=== Value and Method Binding

In JSF you can access the values of a managed bean via
value
binding. For value binding the universal Expression
Language (EL) is
used (to access bean and / or methods). In JSF you
do not need to
specify the get() or set() method but just the
variable name.
Method binding can be used to bind a JSF component, e.g. a
button to an method of a Java class.

TIP:  Expression Language statements either start with "${" or with "#{" and end with "}". 
JSP EL expressions are using the ${...} syntax.
These EL expressions are immediately evaluated. 
JSF EL expressions are of the type #{...}. 
These are only evaluated when needed (and otherwise stored as strings).

[[jsf_prerequisites]]
=== Prerequisites to use JSF

To use JSF you need:

* JSF Implementation (in the form of the JSF jars)
* The JSTL tags library
* A Java runtime environment
* A web-container to use JSF in (for example Tomcat)

[[jsf_mainfeatures]]
=== JSF Main features

JSP has the following main features:

* JSP is based on the Model-View-Controller concept
* JSP has a stateful UI component model, e.g. each component is aware of its data
* JSF separates the functionality of a component from the display of the component. 
The renderer is responsible of displaying the component for a certain client. 
This renderer can get exchanged. 
The standard renderer for JSF components is the HTML renderer.
* JSP support listeners on UI components
* JSP support data validation, data binding and data conversion between the UI and the model

[[jsf_jsp]]
=== JSP and JSF

In this tutorial the JSF application will be build based on
JavaServer Pages (JSP's). JSTL tags are used to include JSF UI
components into the
JSP. This is standard in JSF 1.2. The JSF 2.0
version is
using
Facelets.
