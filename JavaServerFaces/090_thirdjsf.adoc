[[thirdjsf]]
== JSF application with a controller

We will now extend the example from the previous chapter to a
math trainer. The system will propose two number and the user must
multiply both values and input the result.
 This JSF application will use a controller which handles the JSF
logic. This will allow you to create a domain model without
application logic.

TIP:  In general it is considered as a good design practice to keep the model independently from the application logic.

This example will also demonstrate the usage of dependency
injection in JSF.

[[thirdjsf_project]]
=== Create JSF Project

Create a new Dynamic Web Project "de.vogella.jsf.card".

[[thirdjsf_model]]
=== Domain model

Create a new package de.vogella.jsf.card.model and the following class.

[source,java]
----
include::res/thirdjsf/Card.java[]
----

[[thirdjsf_controller]]
=== Controller

Create the following class CardController.

[source,java]
----
include::res/thirdjsf/CardController.java[]
----

This class has a field resultPanel. This field will later get
connected to a UIComponent (panel) from the JSP.

[[thirdjsf_managedbeans]]
=== Register your managed beans- Dependency injection

Double-click on faces-config.xml and select the tab
"ManagedBeans". Register the classes "CardController" and "Card" as
managed beans. The scope of card will be set to none as it will be
inserted into the ControllerCard via dependency injection. In the
initialization tab maintain the data as displayed in the screenshot.
The value #{card} refers to the  managed bean "card".

The generated XML code should look like the following (you see this if you select the tab "Source").

[source,text]
----
include::res/thirdjsf/managedBean.txt[]
----

[[thirdjsf_resourcebundle]]
=== Resource bundle for messages

Create the following file "messages.properties" in your source folder under the package "de.vogella.jsf.card".

[source,text]
----
include::res/thirdjsf/messages.properties[]
----

[[thirdjsf_firstjsp]]
=== JavaServer Page with JSF components

Create a new JSP page "Trainer.jsp" and change the code to the following:

[source,text]
----
include::res/thirdjsf/Trainer.jsp[]
----

From the previously examples you should be able to read most of the fields. 
What is new is that is use now the binding. 
Binding allows to bind certain UIControls to a managed bean. 
This way be bind the panel for the result to the controller. 
The controller can then set the rendered attribute of this UIControl depending on the user settings.

[[thirdjsf_run]]
=== Run your webapplication

To run your webapplication, select Trainer.jsp, right
mouse-click- >run as -> run on server.
