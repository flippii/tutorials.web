== Exercise - Creating an UI Frontend

=== Target

In this exercise a UI frontend is created.
Later on different JavaScript frameworks like Rest and React will be used.

=== Change the root URI for the rest API

Since the root URI, e.g., 

....
http://localhost:8080/
....

of a web application should show an UI to the user rather than json or xml, the root URI for the rest API should be changed.

This can be done by using the `spring.data.rest.base-path` property in the _application.properties_.

[source, properties]
----
spring.data.rest.base-path=/api
----

The _application.properties_ file is usually located in _src/main/resources/application.properties_.

WARNING: Now the URLs, which were used in the `CommandLineRunner` from previous exercises have to be adjusted.

=== Creating an index.html single page app

For the UI an index.html file should be created, which contains the single page app powered by https://facebook.github.io/react/[React].

For now the _index.html_ file should look like this:

[source, html]
----
include::res/js/index-first.html[]
----

The _index.html_ file has to be located in _src/main/resources/templates_.

=== Creating a @Controller for the UI

To let the root URI point to this _index.html_ file, the mapping to the _index_ has to be defined.

[source, java]
----
include::res/js/RootUriController.java[]
----

=== Validate

Start the Spring Application, open up the 

....
http://localhost:8080/
....

in a browser and see whether _Hello Spring!_ is shown.
