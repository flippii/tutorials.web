== Exercise - Spring DI Bean Config

=== Target

In the <<exercise_springfirstdi>> exercise the Todo was created automatically by using the `@Component` annotation.

But since the Spring DI Container does not contain any objects, which are expected as constructor parameter in the `Todo` implementation the no arg constructor is always used.

=== Using a custom constructor for Components/Beans

In order to explicitly create a `Todo` instance a method in the `Config` class annotated with the `@Bean` annotation can be used.

=== Validate 1

Now run the `Application` class again and try to fix the error.

=== Fixing the NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException

Due to the `@Component` annotation on the `Todo` and the new `@Bean` method two Components/Beans are provided and Spring cannot decide, which one to choose.

This ambiguity has to be handled. Therefore either the `@Component` annotation on the `Todo` has to be removed again or the `@Primary` can be added.

include::res/di/ConfigExplicitPrimary.java[]

=== Validate 2

Run the `Application` class and see that an implementation of the `ITodo` interface is found and provided by the `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext`.

Besides the console output of the Spring framework this should be printed to the console:
