== Exercise - Using rest.js

=== Target

In this exercise rest.js, which is a minimalistic rest client for JavaScript, should be used to query the rest endpoints.

=== Configure the rest.js

In rest.js several different interceptors and converter can be configured.

For this example the hal+json mime type is used.

To configure a rest.js instance a _restclient.js_ script is created inside the _static_ directory.

[source, javascript]
----
include::res/js/restclient.js[]
----

This _restclient.js_ script can then be obtained and used in the _app.js_ like this:

[source, javascript]
----
include::res/js/app-restclient.js[]
----

<1> Require the previously specified rest client
<2> Query a certain path and handle the returning response
<3> Handle the error case
